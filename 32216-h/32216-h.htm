<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span> was</span> sitting on the conning tower
smoking a cigarette. Then the
splash of a wave soaked it. I tried to
draw another puff. It tasted loathsome
and frizzled. Then I became
angry and threw it away.</p>

<p>I can see my reader&#8217;s surprised expression.
You had expected to read a
serious U-boat story and now such a
ridiculous beginning! But I know what
I am doing. If I had once thrown myself
into the complicated U-boat system
and used a bunch of technical terms,
this story would be shorter and more
quickly read through, but you would
not have understood half of it.</p>

<p>Seriousness will come, bitter and pitiable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
seriousness. In fact, everything is
serious which is connected with the life
on board a submarine and none of it is
funny; although in fact it is the hundred
small inconveniences and peculiar
conditions on a U-boat which make
life on it remarkably characteristic.
And in order to bring to the public a
closer knowledge concerning the peculiar
life on board a U-boat I am writing
this story. Good&#8212;therefore my log-book!
Yes, why should I not make
use of it? To this I also wish to add
that I not only used my own log-book
but also at many places had use of other
U-boats&#8217; logs in order to present one
or another episode which is worth the
while relating. Thus, for example, the
story of the many fishing-smacks, which
are spoken of in the chapter called
&#8220;Rich Spoils,&#8221; is borrowed, but the happenings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
in the witch kettle, the adventure
with the English bulldog, and also
most of the other chapters are my own
feathers with which I have adorned this
little story. This is the only liberal
right of an author which I permit myself.
The style of the story from a log-book
is simple and convenient, and one
buys so willingly such stories. See there
two valid reasons for making use of it.</p>

<h3>OUR FIRST SUCCESS</h3>

<p class="neg"><i>At the hunting grounds North Sea,
April 12, 19&#8212; Course: northwest.
Wind: southwest, strength 3-4. Sea:
strength 3. View: good. Both machines
in high speed.</i></p>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>e</span> were very comfortable in
the conning tower because the
weather was fine and the sun burned
with its heat our field-gray skin jackets.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon we will have summer,&#8221; I said
to the officer on guard, Lieutenant
Petersen, who was sitting with me on
the conning tower&#8217;s platform. I felt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
entirely too hot in my thick underwear.</p>

<p>Petersen, who, like me, was sitting
with his legs dangling in the open hatch
on whose edge we had placed ourselves,
put his hand on the deck and loosened
the thick, camel&#8217;s wool scarf, twice
wrapped around his neck, as if suddenly
he realized it was too hot for him,
too.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll soon discharge this one
from service,&#8221; said Petersen, and pulled
at the faithful winter friend as if he
wished to strip it off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too hasty, my dear lieutenant,&#8221;
I replied laughing. &#8220;Just wait
until to-night, and then I am sure that
you will repent and take your faithful
friend back into the service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we going to keep above the water
to-night, Herr Captain-Lieutenant,
or are we to submerge?&#8221; he asked me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;It depends on what comes up,&#8221; I
answered. &#8220;It rests as usual with the
weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus we were talking and smoking
on the conning tower while our eyes
scanned the horizon and kept a sharp
lookout all around us.</p>

<p>On the little platform, which in a
sharp angle triangle unites itself from
behind with the tower, the subordinate
officer corporal was on guard, and with
a skin cloth was cleaning the lenses on
his double spy-glass, which were wet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you also get a dousing, Krappohl?&#8221;
I asked. &#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t look
out, either. That rascal soaked my cigarette
just as he did the lenses on your
spy-glass. That&#8217;s the dickens of a
trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the word &#8220;rascal&#8221; I meant the
splashing wave, which, while the sea was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in a perfect calm, without any reason
climbed up to us on the tower. If there
had been a storm it would have been
nothing to mention. Then we often
did not have a dry thread on our bodies.
But such a shameless scoundrel, which
in the midst of the most beautiful
weather suddenly throws himself over a
person, is something to make one angry.</p>

<p>We made good speed. The water,
which was thrown aside by the bow,
passed by us in two wide white formed
streaks. The motor rattled and rumbled,
and the ventilation machine in the
so-called &#8220;Centrale&#8221; right under our
feet made a monotonous buzzing.
Through the only opening where the air
could pass out, the open tower hatch,
all kinds of odors flowed one after another
from the lower regions right by
our noses. First we smelled smear-oil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Then the fragrance of oranges (we had
with us a large shipment, which we had
received as a gift of love), and now&#8212;ah!
Now it was coffee, a strong aromatic
coffee odor.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Petersen moved back and
forth unrestingly on the &#8220;swimwest,&#8221;
with which he had tried to make it a
little more comfortable for himself on
the hard sitting place, bent deeper and
deeper down into the hatch inhaling
with greed the odor from below, and
said, as he in pleasant anticipation began
to rub his hands together:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll have coffee, Herr Captain-Lieutenant!&#8221;</p>

<p>I had just with a great deal of trouble
pulled out a cigarette-case from the
inside pocket of my skin jacket and
was groping in my other pockets for
matches, when a hand (the gloves number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
9&frac12;) with outstretched forefinger
reached towards me from behind and
the subordinate officer&#8217;s excited voice
announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;A cloud of smoke four points
port.&#8221;</p>

<p>As quickly as lightning the spy-glass
was placed to the eye. &#8220;Where? Oh,
yes, there. I can see it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As yet, only smoke can be seen.
Isn&#8217;t it so?&#8221;</p>

<p>In what a suspense we were now.
Leaning forward, and with the glasses
pressed to the eye, we gazed on the little,
distant, cloud of smoke. It curled,
then bent with the wind and slowly dissolved
in a long, thin veil-like streak.
Nothing but smoke could be seen, a
sign that the air was clear, and one
could see all the way to the extreme
horizon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>What kind of a ship could it be,
which the curved form of the earth still
concealed from our view? Was it a
harmless freighter, a proud passenger
steamer, an auxiliary cruiser, or maybe
an armored cruiser jammed with cannon?</p>

<p>It was with a feeling, wavering between
hope and fear, that these thoughts
occupied my mind&#8212;fear, not for the
enemy, because we were anxious to meet
him&#8212;but fear that a disappointment
would fall on us, if the ship proved to
be a neutral steamer when it came
closer. Seven times we had during three
days experienced such disappointment,
seven times we had met neutral
ships without contraband on board, and
had been compelled to let them continue
on their way.</p>

<p>The distance between us and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
steamer had not diminished, so that its
masts and a funnel arose above the horizon,
two narrow, somewhat slanting
lines, between which there was a thicker
dark spot. A common freighter, therefore.
This we saw at the first glance.
I changed our course northwardly in
order to head off the course of the
steamer which was going in an easterly
direction. With the highest speed the
machine could make we raced to meet
them and the bridge and part of the hull
could already be seen.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the diving stations! Artillery
alarm. Cannon service on deck! First
torpedo tube ready for fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>With loud voice I called down these
commands into the boat.</p>

<p>There was a stir in the passages below
like when a stone is thrown into
the midst of a swarm of bees. From<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
below it arose, and the men who were
to serve at the cannons crowded on the
narrow precipitous ladder, swung themselves
through the tower hatch and
leaped on the deck. Now, first, just
once, a deep breath, so that the lungs
can draw the refreshing sea air, and
then with their sleeves turned up and
flashing eyes to the guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you see any neutral signs,
Petersen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Herr Captain-Lieutenant. The
entire hull is black. It&#8217;s an Englishman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The flag of war to the mast! The
usual signals ready!&#8221; I called down into
the tower.</p>

<p>Immediately our flag of war floated
from the top of the mast behind the
tower. It told the men over there:
&#8220;Here am I, a German submarine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
U-boat. Now for it, you proud Britisher!
Now it will be seen who rules
the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>We had gradually drawn closer to a
distance of about six thousand meters.
At last an enemy! After so many neutral
steamers. At last an enemy! An
intense joy thrilled us, a joy which only
can be compared with the hunter&#8217;s
when he sees at last the longed-for prey
coming within range, after long and
fruitless efforts. We had traveled many
hundred sea miles. We had endured
storm, cold, and at times had been
drenched to the skin, and there, only
two points port, our first success was
waving towards us!</p>

<p>By this time we must have been discovered
by the steamer. Now our flag
of war must have been recognized. A
ghastly horror must have seized the captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
on the bridge: The U-boat terror!
the U-boat pest!</p>

<p>But the captain on the steamer did
not give in so easily. He tried to save
himself by flight. Suddenly we saw
how the steamer belched forth thicker
and darker clouds of smoke and in a
sharp curve turned port. Its propeller
water, which hitherto could hardly be
seen, was whipped to a white foam, and
let us know the machines had been put
into the highest possible speed. But it
was of no use. No matter how much
the captain was shouting and how much
the machinist drove his sweating and
naked fire crew to even more than human
endeavors, so that the coal flew
about and the boilers were red, everything
was useless. We closed in on
him with a horrible certainty nearer
and nearer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>For some time I had been standing
high up on the tower with a spy-glass
before my eyes and did not lose one of
the steamer&#8217;s motions. Now it seemed
to me the right moment had come to
energetically command the steamer to
stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;A shot above the steamer! Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The granate landed two hundred meters
in front of the steamer. We waited
a few minutes, but when the shot did
not cause any change I gave the right
distance to the gunners and shouted the
command to aim at the steamer. The
second shot hit and a thick, black and
yellow cloud from the explosion shot
into the air. The third shot tore a piece
off the funnel, the fourth hit the bridge,
and before the fifth had left the mouth
of the gun the signal flew up, &#8220;I have
stopped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah! old friend, you had come to it,
anyhow!</p>

<p>An old sea-rule says: &#8220;Carefulness
is the best seamanship.&#8221; Regarding all
the tricks and subterfuges which the
hostile merchant-marine has used
against us, I did not consider it advisable
to advance nearer the steamer at
once. I therefore also stopped our machines
and signaled: &#8220;Leave the ship
immediately!&#8221;</p>

<p>The signal was unnecessary. The
English captain had himself given the
command to the crew to take to the
boats after he, frothing with anger, had
comprehended the impossibility to flee.
Snorting with wrath, he shortly afterwards
came alongside our boat, and
handed me at my request the ship&#8217;s papers
and asked me to tow the three
boats to the neighborhood of the coast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
I promised this and said some simple
words to him in regard to his bad luck
and concerning the grim necessity of the
war&#8212;which he dismissed with an angry
shrug of his shoulders. I certainly could
understand the man&#8217;s bad spirit.</p>

<p>I then went forward and torpedoed
the steamer, which sank, stern foremost,
with a gurgling sound into the
deep.</p>

<p>At the same time four thousand tons
of rice were lost to the English market.</p>

<p>We had met with success and this
put us into the highest spirits. Come
whatever wants to come, our voyage had
not been entirely useless.</p>

<p>When I stepped down into the boat
for a moment and passed through the
narrow crew-room to my own little
cabin, I saw to right and left joyful
faces, and all eyes were smiling towards<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
me as if they wished to say:
&#8220;Congratulations!&#8221; The steamer&#8217;s sinking
was the subject of discussion.
Those who had witnessed the incident
had to describe all the circumstances in
smallest detail; where the torpedo had
struck, how high the water-pillar had
risen, and what afterwards happened
to the steamer, how the people on the
boat looked, and the like. Everything
had to be explained.</p>

<p>When I went back some one said:
&#8220;To-morrow it will be in the papers.&#8221;
These words whirled around in my head
for some time. Yes, to-morrow there
would be in all the German newspapers
under the column: &#8220;Ships sunk&#8221; or
&#8220;Sacrifices to the U-boat war,&#8221; that
once more we had retaliated on our most
hated enemy, that his inhuman attempt
to starve our people had been parried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
by a horrid and strong blow. And over
there upon his isle our relentless enemy
would receive the same kind of a newspaper
notice. The only difference was
that there it would cause fury instead
of joy, and the dried-up old English
editor would stare terrified on the telegram
which he would hold in his hand,
pull off his few white threads of hair,
and swear as only an Englishman can
swear.</p>

<p>Even up to the dusk of the night, we
towed the sunken freighter&#8217;s three boats
towards the coast. We then cut loose
in order to get ready to man&#339;uver.
When darkness set in, one had to be
ready for surprises. Besides, we were
not very far from land and the weather
was fair, so that the boats could be in
no danger. As a refreshment, I had
three bottles of wine brought over to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the captain of the ill-fated ship, and
left him with best greetings to Mr.
Churchill and his colleagues.</p>

<p>The last streak of day became paler
and paler in the west. The spook-like
red cloud-riders stretched themselves
more and more, became indistinct,
pulled themselves asunder, and at once
were swept away. In their place appeared
the dark demon of the night,
spread itself over heaven, hid all the
stars, and settled heavily over the sea.</p>

<p>This was just a night suitable for us.
One could not see one&#8217;s hand before the
eye. The steel covers on the tower windows
were tightly shut, so that the least
ray of light could not escape. Entirely
invisible we were gliding forward in the
dark. Dumb and immovable, each one
was sitting at his post&#8212;the lieutenant,
the subordinate officer, and the commander&#8212;trying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
with our eyes to pierce
through the darkness and turning our
heads continually from right to left and
back again. The aim of our voyage was
still far off and the fine weather had to
be used.</p>

<p>Weakly, as if from a far distance, the
phonograph&#8217;s song reached us lonely
watchmen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Reach me thy hand, thy dear hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Live well, my treasure, live well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Cause we travel now to Eng-eland,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Live well, my treasure, live well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&#8217;Cause we travel now to Eng-eland.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>



<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></h2>

<h3>AN EVENTFUL NIGHT</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat</span> peculiar sensations filled
me. We were at war&#8212;the most
insane war ever fought! And now I
am a commander on a U-boat!</p>

<p>I said to myself:</p>

<p>&#8220;You submarine, you undersea boat,
you faithful U-202, which has obediently
and faithfully carried me thousands
of miles and will still carry me
many thousand miles! I am a commander
of a submarine which scatters
death and destruction in the ranks of
the enemy, which carries death and hell
fire in its bosom, and which rushes
through the water like a thoroughbred.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
What am I searching for in the cold,
dark night? Do I think about honor
and success? Why does my eye stare
so steadily into the dark? Am I thinking
about death and the innumerable
mines which are floating away off there
in the dark, am I thinking about enemy
scouts which are seeking me?</p>

<p>&#8220;No! It is nerves and foolish sentiments
born of foolish spirits. I am not
thinking about that. Leave me alone
and don&#8217;t bother me. I am the master.
It is the duty of my nerves to
obey. Can you hear the melodious song
from below, you weakling nerves? Are
you so dull and faint hearted that it
does not echo within you? Do you not
know the stimulating power which the
thin metal voice below can inspire within
you?</p>

<p>&#8220;This song brings greetings to you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
from a distance of twelve hundred miles
and through twelve hundred miles it
comes to you. Ahead we must look; we
must force our eyes to pierce the darkness
on all sides.&#8221;</p>

<p>The spy-glass flew to the eye. There
is a flash in the west. A light!</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, there! Hey! There is something
over there&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is no ordinary light. What
about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Petersen was looking
through his night glasses at the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he is signaling,&#8221; he said
excitedly. &#8220;The light flashes continually
to and fro. I hope it is not a scout
ship trying to speak with some one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly had the lieutenant uttered
these words when we all three jumped
as if electrified, because certainly in our
immediate neighborhood flashed before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
us several quick lights giving signals,
which undoubtedly came from the ship
second in line, which was signaling to
our first friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great God! An enemy ship! Not
more than three hundred meters
ahead!&#8221; I exclaimed to myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard a starboard! Both engines at
highest speed ahead! To the diving stations!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a subdued voice, I called my commands
down the tower.</p>

<p>The phonograph in the crew-room
stopped abruptly. A hasty, eager running
was discernible through the entire
boat as each one hurried to his post.</p>

<p>The boat immediately obeyed the rudder
and was flying to starboard. Between
the two hostile ships there was a
continuous exchange of signals.</p>

<p>&#8220;God be praised it is so dark!&#8221; I exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
with a deep breath as soon as
the first danger had passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think that the fellow had to
betray his presence by his chattering
signals just as we were about to run
right into his arms,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;This time we can truly say that the
good God, Himself, had charge of the
rudder.&#8221;</p>

<p>The engineer appeared on the stairway
which leads from the &#8220;Centrale&#8221;
up to the conning tower.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I go to the engine-room, Herr
Captain-Lieutenant?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not permissible for him to
leave his diving station, the &#8220;Centrale,&#8221;
which is situated in the center of the
boat, without special permission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Herr Engineer, go ahead down
and fire up hard!&#8221; I replied.</p>

<p>The thumping of the heavy oil-motors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
became stronger, swelled higher
and higher, and, at last, became a long
drawn out roar, and entirely drowned
the sound of the occasional jolts which
always were distinctly discernible when
going at slower speed. One truly felt
how the boat exerted its strength to the
utmost and did everything within its
power.</p>

<p>We had put ourselves on another
course which put the anxiously signaling
Britishers obliquely aport of our
stern, and rushed with the highest speed
for about ten minutes until their lights
became smaller and weaker. We then
turned point by point into our former
course, and thus slipped by in a large
half circle around the hostile ships.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as a cat around a bowl of hot
oatmeal,&#8221; said Lieutenant Petersen.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear friend,&#8221; I said laughingly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
&#8220;it does not entirely coincide.
The cat always comes back, but the
oatmeal is too hot for us in this case.
Or do you think that I intend to circle
around those two rascals for hours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Preferably not, Herr Captain-Lieutenant.
It could end badly!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both engines in highest speed forward,
let the crew leave the diving stations,
place the guards!&#8221; I ordered.</p>

<p>The danger had passed. Normal conditions
at night could again be resumed.
But before the morning set in, we again
experienced all kinds of adventures.
The night was as if bewitched. There
was no sleep worth mentioning. I had
hardly, towards ten o&#8217;clock, reached my
comfortable little nest where the sailor
Schultes, our own considerate &#8220;cup-bearer,&#8221;
had spread on my miniature
writing-desk the most tempting delicacies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of preserves and fruit together with
a bottle of claret, when a whistle
sounded in the speaking-tube on the
wall right close to my head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whee-e!&#8221; it shrieked, high, penetrating
and alarming.</p>

<p>I jumped up, pulled out the stopper
and put in the mouth-piece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two points from starboard a white
light!&#8221;</p>

<p>I grabbed my cap and gloves and
rushed sternward through the deck officer&#8217;s
room, petty officer&#8217;s room, and
crew-room, each one narrower than the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, the commander!&#8221; they
shouted to one another, and pulled in
their legs so that I could get by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; I bumped my head hard
against the stand of an electric lamp. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
rubbed the sore spot as I hurried ahead,
while I took an oath to myself that the
lamp should be moved at the first possible
opportunity. I hurried through
the &#8220;Centrale,&#8221; up the narrow stairway.
Then I reached my place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; Lieutenant Gr&ouml;ning, who
was on guard, pointed out. &#8220;About
three points starboard!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a steamer. One can already
see the red side lantern. It is crossing
our course.&#8221;</p>

<p>I put my binoculars to the eye and
looked for many seconds for the light.
The officer on guard was right. Besides
the white lantern, one could see a deep,
red light. The ship therefore was traveling
towards the left and would cross
our course.</p>

<p>A narrow strip of the moon had appeared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
from out of the sea and was
wrestling with the darkness of the night.
The result was not much&#8212;the strip of
the moon was too small for that&#8212;still
it was not so dark as before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it come too close to us!&#8221; I
ordered. &#8220;And get clear in right time.
We must not under any circumstances
be seen by it, because then they would
soon know in England from which direction
to expect us. Now nearly every
steamer has a wireless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gr&ouml;ning changed the course to port
until he had the steamer completely to
the left.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad, we can&#8217;t take it with us,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you know, for a night attack
this is not the right place. Here so
many neutral steamers travel, and an
error can easily be made.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was shortly after ten o&#8217;clock.
At eleven-twenty, twelve forty, one-ten,
three-fifteen, and five o&#8217;clock I again
heard the whistling &#8220;Whee-e!&#8221; in the
speaking-tube by my bunk. Each time
I had to jump out of some dream, realize
within a fraction of a second that
my presence was desired up-stairs, grab
my cap and gloves, and rush through
the boat&#8217;s long body up to the tower,
not without several times bumping into
the aforementioned and often damned
electric lamp.</p>

<p>After five o&#8217;clock in the morning I
remained on deck, because dawn would
soon break with its treacherous light.
The commander&#8217;s post is in the tower
at such a time because, just as easily
as one perceives in the pale gray light
a ship, one is also visible from the
steamer, which could cause many unpleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
surprises if the two ships are
not very cordial towards each other&#8212;especially
disagreeable to us because a
submarine is, as our name indicates, below
the water, and the smallest fragment
of a shell can badly damage our
heel of Achilles, the diving machinery,
so that we would be unable again to
get into a position of safety beneath the
surface.</p>

<p>Shortly before six o&#8217;clock I had the
entire crew at the diving stations. Each
took his place, ready at a given command
to open or shut the valve, crank,
or bolt of which he had charge. Only
the cook had no special duty besides his
own. He remained with the electric
cooking apparatus provided in the galley
and had no other job besides taking
care of our bodily comfort. Now he
was, in conformity with his duty, busy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
making coffee as was proper at that
time of day.</p>

<p>A fine, strong smell of coffee percolated
through the whole ship, which
proved to be a great stimulant to
our taut nerves and our empty stomachs.</p>

<p>I have to deviate a little from the subject
for the purpose of asking if my
readers understand me. Is it above all
plain, explicit, and clear why I give
so much space to a discussion of the
nerves when I speak about us, U-boat
men, and so often refer to them? The
nerves are in time of peace the Alpha
and Omega for a U-boat officer. How
much more so when we are at war! The
nerves to us mean power to act, decision,
strength, will, and perseverance. The
nerves are valuable and to keep them in
good condition is of the greatest importance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and an obligation and duty during
a voyage.</p>

<p>There we sit hour after hour in the
conning tower. Beneath is the most
complicated mechanism the genius of
man has ever created. And all around
there are the most craftily constructed
instruments for the purpose of destroying
that which cost so much labor to
create. Mines, nets, explosives, shells,
and sharp keels are our enemies, which,
at any moment, may send us high in
the air or hundreds of meters into the
ocean. Everywhere perils lurk. The
whole sea is a powder barrel.</p>

<p>For all this there is only one remedy&#8212;nerves!</p>

<p>To make the right decision at the
right moment is the first and last of
U-boat science. One glance must be
enough to determine the position. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the same second a decision must be
made, and the commands carried out.
A moment&#8217;s hesitation may be fatal.</p>

<p>I can give an example of this on the
very morning I speak of.</p>

<p>It was three minutes after six o&#8217;clock,
and within about half an hour the sun
would rise, but the sea and the sky still
floated together in the colorless drab
of early dawn and permitted one only
to imagine, not see, that partition wall,
the horizon.</p>

<p>Unceasingly our binoculars pierced
the gray dusk of daybreak. Suddenly
a shiver went through my body when&#8212;only
a second immovable and in intense
suspense&#8212;a dark shadow within range
of the spy-glass made me jump. The
shadow grew and became larger, like a
giant on the horizon&#8212;one mast; one,
two, three, four funnels&#8212;a destroyer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>A quick command&#8212;I leap down into
the tower. The water rushes into the
diving tanks. The conning tower covers
slam tight behind me&#8212;and the
agony which follows tries our patience,
while we count seconds with watches in
hand until the tanks are filled, and the
boat slips below the sea.</p>

<p>Never in my life did a second seem so
long to me. The destroyer, which is
not more than two thousand meters distant
from us, has, of course, seen us,
and is speeding for us as fast as her
forty thousand horse power can drive
her. From the guns mounted on her
bow flash one shot after another aimed
to destroy us.</p>

<p>Good God! If he only does not hit!
Just one little hit, and we are lost! Already
the water splashes on the outside
of the conning tower up to the glass<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
windows through which I see the dark
ghost, streaking straight for us. It is
terrifying to hear the shells bursting all
around us in the water. It sounds like
a triphammer against a steel plate, and
closer and closer come the metallic
crashes. The rascal is getting our
range.</p>

<p>There&#8212;the fifth shot&#8212;the entire
boat trembles&#8212;then the deceitful daylight
disappears from the conning
tower window. The boat obeys the diving
rudder and submerges into the sea.</p>

<p>A reddish-yellow light shines all
around us; the indicator of the manometer,
which measures our depth, points
to eight meters, nine meters, ten meters,
twelve meters. Saved!</p>

<p>What a happy, unexplainable sensation
to know that you are hiding deep in
the infinite ocean! The heart, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
had stopped beating during these long
seconds because it had no time to beat,
again begins its pounding.</p>

<p>Our boat sinks deeper and deeper. It
obeys, as does a faithful horse the slightest
pressure of a rider&#8217;s knees, which,
in this case, are the diving rudders
placed in the bow and the stern. The
manometer now shows twenty-four meters,
twenty-six meters. I had given orders
we should go down to thirty meters.</p>

<p>Above us we still hear the roaring and
crackling in the water, as if it were in an
impotent rage. I turn and smile at the
mate who is standing with me in the
conning tower&#8212;a happy, care-free
smile. I point upwards with my thumb.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you hear it? Do you hear it?&#8221;</p>

<p>It is an unnecessary question, of
course, because he hears it as plainly as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I do, and all the others aboard hear
it, too. But the question can still be explained
because of the tremendous strain
on our nerves which has to express itself
even in such a simple question.</p>

<p>Dear, true, splendid little boat, how
one learns to love you during such trying
moments and would like to pet you
like a living human being for your understanding
and obedience! We, here
on board, all depend upon you, just as
we all depend upon one another. We
are chained together. We will face the
dangers together and gain success.</p>

<p>You blond heroes who are standing
down there in the bowels of the boat
without knowing what is happening up
in the light, but still knowing that the
crucial moment has arrived&#8212;that life
or death to every one depends on one
man&#8217;s will and one man&#8217;s decision; you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
who, with a calm and strong feeling of
duty, stick at your posts with all the
strength of your bodies and souls
strained to the breaking point and still
keep full faith in him who is your leader,
chief, and commander; you show the
highest degree of bravery and self-control,
you who never have a chance to see
the enemy but still, with sustained calm,
do your duty.</p>

<p>Not a word was uttered, not a sound
disturbed that deadly stillness on board.
One almost forgot that the men were
standing with strained nerves at their
posts in order to keep the wonderful
mechanism running right. One could
hear the soft whirr of the dynamos and,
more and more distant, the crackling of
the exploding shells. Suddenly even
this stopped. The Britisher must have
noticed that the fish had slipped out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
his hand. Shortly thereafter we heard
his propellers churning the water above
us. Soon this noise died away as it had
come, growing fainter and fainter in a
kind of grinding whirr.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear how he circled around
over us?&#8221; I asked through the speaking
tube which led down into the &#8220;Centrale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. That could clearly be
distinguished,&#8221; was the short answer.</p>

<p>I was pondering over what to do next.
At first we had no choice but to dive
at the first sight of the destroyer suddenly
appearing with the break of
day.</p>

<p>In our capacity as an undersea boat,
we were now in a position to fight on
equal terms, and I decided to risk a
bout with him as soon as it became light
enough for me to see through the periscope.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
The intervening time I made
use of by having passed up to me in the
tower the long desired cup of morning
coffee, in order to stop the tantalizing
agony which the smell of the coffee had
caused my empty stomach. Thereupon
we slowly climbed upwards from our
safe breakfast depth of thirty meters.
The higher we came&#8212;one can read on
the manometer how we are ascending
meter by meter&#8212;the greater became the
excitement and tension. Without
breathing we listened.</p>

<p>Slowly the boat rose. The top of the
periscope would soon be thrust above
the surface. My hands clasped the
handle with which the well-oiled, and
therefore easily movable, periscope can
be turned around as quickly as lightning,
in order to take a sweep around
the horizon. My eye was pressed to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
sight, and soon I perceived that the
water was getting clearer and clearer
by degrees and more transparent. I
could now follow the ascent of the boat
without consulting the manometer.</p>

<p>My heart was pounding with the
huntsman&#8217;s fervor, in expectation of
what I was to see at my first quick
glance around the horizon, because the
destroyer, which we sighted only a quarter
of an hour before, could be only a
scouting ship. It might belong to a
detachment of naval scouts to protect a
larger ship. In my thoughts I saw the
whole eastern horizon full of proud
ships under England&#8217;s flag surrounded
by smoke.</p>

<p>I did not see anything, no matter how
carefully I scanned the horizon. All I
could see was the reddening morning
blush spread over half of the eastern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
sky, the last stars now paling and the
rising sun showing its first beams.</p>

<p>&#8220;For heaven&#8217;s sake, nobody is here,&#8221;
I grumbled to myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;ll surely come back, Captain,&#8221;
said my mate with true optimism.
&#8220;The prey was too hot for him to tackle
and now he has started to fetch a couple
more to help him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would certainly be less desirable,&#8221;
put in Lieutenant Gr&ouml;ning, who, full of
expectations, was standing halfway up
the stairway leading from the tower to
the &#8220;Centrale&#8221; and had overheard our
talk. &#8220;No, it would be less desirable,&#8221;
he repeated, &#8220;because then comes the
entire swarm of hostile U-boats with
their nets cunningly lined with mines.
No good will ever come of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are right, Gr&ouml;ning,&#8221; I
agreed. &#8220;With that sort of a nuisance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
equipped as they are with so many machines
for our destruction, it would be
very disagreeable to make their acquaintance.
If they come, it is best to
disappear. It is not worth the risk. We
have many more important duties ahead
of us. It would be too bad to spoil a
good torpedo on such trash.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same time, I decided to rise so
as to get a better observation through
the periscope and once more look
around the horizon. I suddenly observed
in the northeast a peculiar, dark
cloud of smoke. I, therefore, did not
give any orders to arise, but told &#8220;Centrale&#8221;
by a few short commands through
the speaking tube the new turn of affairs
and, with added speed, went to meet
the smoke cloud.</p>

<h3>THE SINKING OF THE TRANSPORT</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>oon</span> the outlines of a ship told us
that ahead of us was a large
steamer, steaming westward at high
speed. The disappointment which we
experienced at first was soon reversed
when it was clearly shown that the fortunes
of war had again sent a ship
across our course which belonged to a
hostile power.</p>

<p>No flag could be seen&#8212;nor was it
run up. Otherwise we would have
seen it.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a suspicious circumstance,&#8221;
I reasoned with myself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>I called down to the &#8220;Centrale&#8221; all
my observations through the periscope
at regular intervals, snapping them out
in the same sharp, brief style that the
newsboys use in calling out the headlines
to the listening public. My words
were passed in whispers from mouth to
mouth until all hands on board knew
what was going on above the surface.
Each new announcement from the conning
tower caused great excitement
among the crew, listening and holding
their breath and, I believe, if you could
measure the tension on human nerves
with a barometer, it would have registered
to the end of the tube, when, like
hammer beats, these words went down
to the &#8220;Centrale&#8221;:</p>

<p>&#8220;The steamer&#8217;s armed! Take a look,
mate.&#8221;</p>

<p>I stepped away from the sights of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
periscope. &#8220;Can you see the gun
mounted forward of the bridge?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, certainly,&#8221; he replied excitedly.
&#8220;I can see it, and quite a large piece it
is, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now take a look at her stern&#8212;right
by the second mast&#8212;what do you notice
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thousand devils! Another cannon&#8212;at
least a ten-centimeter gun. It&#8217;s a
transport, sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop the periscope! Port ten!&#8221; I
commanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Torpedo tube ready!&#8221; reported
the torpedo master through the tube
from the forward torpedo compartment.</p>

<p>By this time I had the periscope submerged
so that we were completely below
the surface and out of sight, and it
would be impossible to discover us from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the steamer, even after the most careful
searching of the horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Advance on the enemy!&#8221; was our
determination.</p>

<p>Oh, what a glorious sensation is a
U-boat attack! What a great understanding
and co&ouml;peration between a
U-boat and its crew&#8212;between dead
matter and living beings! What a
merging into a single being, of the
nerves and spirits of an entire crew!</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as if the whole boat is as one
being,&#8221; was the thought that passed
through my mind when I, with periscope
down, went at my antagonist, just
like a great crouching cat with her back
bowed and her hair on end, ready to
spring. The eye is the periscope, the
brain the conning tower, the heart the
&#8220;Centrale,&#8221; the legs the engines, and
the teeth and claws the torpedoes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Noiselessly we slipped closer and
closer in our exciting chase. The main
thing was that our periscope should not
be observed, or the steamer might
change her course at the last moment
and escape us. Very cautiously, I
stuck just the tip of the periscope above
the surface at intervals of a few minutes,
took the position of the steamer in
a second and, like a flash, pulled it down
again. That second was sufficient for
me to see what I wanted to see. The
steamer was to starboard and was heading
at a good speed across our bows. To
judge from the foaming waves which
were cut off from the bow, I calculated
that her speed must be about sixteen
knots.</p>

<p>The hunter knows how important it is
to have a knowledge of the speed at
which his prey is moving. He can calculate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the speed a little closer when it is
a wounded hare than when it is one
which in flight rushes past at high
speed.</p>

<p>It was only necessary for me, therefore,
to calculate the speed of the ship
for which a sailor has an experienced
eye. I then plotted the exact angle we
needed. I measured this by a scale
which had been placed above the sights
of the periscope. Now I only had to
let the steamer come along until it had
reached the zero point on the periscope
and fire the torpedo, which then must
strike its mark.</p>

<p>You see, it is very plain; I estimate
the speed of the boat, aim with the periscope
and fire at the right moment.</p>

<p>He who wishes to know about this or
anything else in this connection should
join the navy, or if he is not able to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
so, send us his son or brother or
nephew.</p>

<p>On the occasion in question everything
went as calculated. The steamer
could not see our cautious and hardly-shown
periscope and continued unconcerned
on its course. The diving rudder
in the &#8220;Centrale&#8221; worked well and
greatly facilitated my unobserved approach.
I could clearly distinguish the
various objects on board, and saw the
giant steamer at a very short distance&#8212;how
the captain was walking back
and forth on the bridge with a short
pipe in his mouth, how the crew was
scrubbing the forward deck. I saw with
amazement&#8212;a shiver went through me&#8212;a
long line of compartments of wood
spread over the entire deck, out of
which were sticking black and brown
horse heads and necks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, great Scott! Horses! What a
pity! Splendid animals!</p>

<p>&#8220;What has that to do with it?&#8221; I continually
thought. War is war. And
every horse less on the western front is
to lessen England&#8217;s defense. I have to
admit, however, that the thought which
had to come was disgusting, and I wish
to make the story about it short.</p>

<p>Only a few degrees were lacking for
the desired angle, and soon the steamer
would get into the correct focus. It was
passing us at the right distance, a few
hundred meters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Torpedo ready!&#8221; I called down into
the &#8220;Centrale.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the longed-for command.
Every one on board held his breath.
Now the steamer&#8217;s bow cut the line in
the periscope&#8212;now the deck, the bridge,
the foremast&#8212;the funnel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Let go!&#8221;</p>

<p>A light trembling shook the boat&#8212;the
torpedo was on its way. Woe, when
it was let loose!</p>

<p>There it was speeding, the murderous
projectile, with an insane speed straight
at its prey. I could accurately follow
its path by the light wake it left in the
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty seconds,&#8221; counted the mate
whose duty it was, with watch in hand,
to calculate the exact time elapsed after
the torpedo was fired until it exploded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twenty-two seconds!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it must happen&#8212;the terrible
thing!</p>

<p>I saw the ship&#8217;s people on the bridge
had discovered the wake which the torpedo
was leaving, a slender stripe. How
they pointed with their fingers out
across the sea in terror; how the captain,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
covering his face with his hands,
resigned himself to what must come.
And next there was a terrific shaking
so that all aboard the steamer were
tossed about and then, like a volcano,
arose, majestic but fearful in its beauty,
a two-hundred meter high and fifty-meter
wide pillar of water toward the
sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;A full hit behind the second funnel!&#8221;
I called down into the &#8220;Centrale.&#8221;
Then they cut loose down there for joy.
They were carried away by ecstasy
which welled out of their hearts, a joyous
storm that ran through our entire
boat and up to me.</p>

<p>And over there?</p>

<p>Landlubber, steel thy heart!</p>

<p>A terrible drama was being enacted
on the hard-hit sinking ship. It listed
and sank towards us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>From the tower I could observe all
the decks. From all the hatches human
beings forced their way out, fighting
despairingly. Russian firemen, officers,
sailors, soldiers, hostlers, the kitchen
crew, all were running and calling for
the boats. Panic stricken, they thronged
about one another down the stairways,
fighting for the lifeboats, and among
all were the rearing, snorting and kicking
horses. The boats on the starboard
deck could not be put into service, as
they could not be swung clear because
of the list of the careening steamer. All,
therefore, thronged to the boats on the
port side, which, in the haste and anguish,
were lowered, some half empty;
others overcrowded. Those who were
left aboard were wringing their hands
in despair. They ran from bow to stern
and back again from stern to bow in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
their terror, and then finally threw
themselves into the sea in order to attempt
to swim to the boats.</p>

<p>Then another explosion resounded,
after which a hissing white wave of
steam streamed out of all the ports.
The hot steam set the horses crazy, and
they were beside themselves with terror&#8212;I
could see a splendid, dapple-gray
horse with a long tail make a great
leap over the ship&#8217;s side and land in a
lifeboat, already overcrowded&#8212;but
after that I could not endure the terrible
spectacle any longer. Pulling
down the periscope, we submerged into
the deep.</p>

<p>When, after some time, I came again
to the surface there was nothing more
to be seen of the great, proud steamer.
Among the wreckage and corpses of
the horses three boats were floating and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
occasionally fished out a man still swimming
in the sea. Now I came up on
the surface in order to assist the victims
of the wrecked ship. When our boat&#8217;s
mighty, whale-like hull suddenly arose
out of the water, right in their midst, a
panic seized them again and quickly
they grasped their oars in order to try
to flee. Not until I waved from the
tower to them with my handkerchief
and cap did they rest on their oars and
come over to us. The state in which
some of them were was exceedingly pitiful.
Several wore only white cotton
trousers and had handkerchiefs wrapped
around their necks. The fixed provisions
which each boat was required to
carry were not sufficient when the boat&#8217;s
crew was doubled and trebled.</p>

<p>While I was conferring with our mess
officer as to what we could possibly dispense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
with of our own provisions we
noticed to the north and west some
clouds of smoke which, to judge from
the signs, were coming towards us
quickly. Immediately a thought flashed
through my head:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now they are looking for you. Now
comes the whole swarm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Already the typical masts of the
British destroyers and trawlers arose
above the horizon. We, therefore, did
not have a minute to lose in order to
escape these hostile and most dangerous
enemies. I made my decision quickly
and called to the captain of the sunken
steamer that he could let one of the
oncoming ships pick them up as I could
not spare the time, but had to go &#8220;northeast.&#8221;
Then I submerged&#8212;right in
front of the boats full of survivors.
They saw me head north and I steered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in that direction for a time. Then I
pulled down the periscope and, without
being noticed, changed my course
to the south.</p>

<p>When I, after a considerable time,
again cautiously looked around, I perceived
to my amazement that an entire
scout fleet in a wide circle was heading
towards us from the south also. From
three sides the enemy spurred his bloodhounds
on us, and I thought to myself
it would not take long before, by extending
their wings, they would encircle
us completely, and the great chase
would begin. The thought was not
cheerful, particularly as the depths in
this part of the ocean were not sufficient
so that we could, by submerging
deeply, guard ourselves against the
dangers of grappling hooks, nets and
mines.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The wildcat has become a hare,&#8221; I
thought to myself and, at the same time,
I decided what to do.</p>

<p>We had to do as the old hare. First,
with eyes open, we would cautiously
jump forth, use all possible covers, and
search for the spot where the gunners
were fewest, and then with eyes shut
and at the highest possible speed break
through the widest gap.</p>

<p>Consequently, we began to travel
toward the east where the &#8220;atmosphere
was still clear.&#8221; Occasionally I stuck
up my periscope and perceived how the
surrounding circle was knit tighter and
tighter. Now, after I had made up my
mind, I became completely calm and
carefully considered all the conditions
for and against us. The swarm of destroyers
moved toward the center, as
in a regular chase, as soon as the circle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was complete. Between every couple of
hunters&#8212;I mean trawlers&#8212;there were
nets stretched across to catch a little
submarine, and behind these were
dragged mines.</p>

<p>By extending one of the wings in the
north, it made a gap toward the east,
and besides I saw that one of the torpedo
boats between two groups of the
searching parties had left for the shipwrecked
survivors. At this point, consequently,
was our best chance to escape.
I laid my course between the two
searching parties, of course, with the
periscope, during the whole time, nearly
invisible.</p>

<p>Slowly the ranks of the hunting
hounds approached, smoking copiously
and snorting. Now the right moment
had arrived to follow the other part of
the hare&#8217;s program. We shut our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
eyes&#8212;that is, I pulled the periscope
down completely&#8212;and proceeded with
increased speed, submerging in the sea
as deeply as possible.</p>

<p>I can well imagine how the old hare
felt when he ran blindly for his life.
Undoubtedly our feelings were somewhat
the same. How easily could not
that little gap toward which we were
making be closed by some small auxiliary
of the searchers.</p>

<p>And, if the grappling hooks from
one of these got hold of us, there would
be little hope of escape, or of saving
ourselves. Then they would tear at us
from all directions and give us the stab
that would send us deep down into the
sea for good. No one on board suspected
what danger we went to meet.
I had kept all my observations concerning
the enemy&#8217;s surrounding us to myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and had not mentioned it, so as not
to excite everybody&#8217;s mind. No one
below could at any rate do anything to
change the conditions.</p>

<p>Then from the bow compartment
came the report:</p>

<p>&#8220;The beating of propellers is discernible
to port!&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter I could hear them,
even from the conning tower&#8212;a soft,
slow, swelling, and grinding sound.
This was not the sound of the propellers
of a destroyer. Such would beat
faster, clearer, and more powerfully.
This was the heavily-dragging trawlers&#8217;
slow beating propellers.</p>

<p>Strainingly I listened to starboard&#8212;nothing
could be heard. That was a
good sign, because I could hope that in
reality I had reached the gap and that
the sounds of the propellers which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
heard to port emanated from the
trawler on the left side of the gap. I
was just about, from my innermost
heart, to let out a joyous &#8220;hurrah,&#8221;
when, from the bow of the boat, I heard
a new sound which approached with a
clear, sharp banging. It was the torpedo-boat,
the beast! Was the rascal
going to come back at the crucial
moment?</p>

<p>It required only a few seconds for
the torpedo-boat to pass over us, but
those seemed as hours. At every blinking
of the eye I imagined I heard something
explode, turn against or drag
alongside my boat. But fortune was
ours. The sharp, grinding sound of the
swift torpedo-boat propellers became
fainter and fainter and, at last, ceased
entirely. Unconsciously I straightened
up a little in the tower, whistled a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
notes from &#8220;Dockan,&#8221; and tapped, as if
nothing had happened, with the knuckle
of my forefinger on the glass of the
manometer. What did the manometer
register? Nothing whatsoever had happened.
Everything was in the best condition.
The depth coincided. The diving
rudder was lying normal. Before
me stood Tuczynski, my faithful helmsman
and orderly, at former times skipper
on the <i>Weichsel</i> and <i>Nogat</i>; behind
me, the mate leaned against the wall of
the conning tower contentedly and
yawned.</p>

<p>I suddenly felt an unresistible craving
for a cigarette. The nerves needed
some stimulation. For about ten minutes
I controlled myself. Then I arose
to a periscope distance from the surface
and took a look around to see how
things were going. What I saw filled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
my heart with joy. The whole swarm
of British destroyers and trawlers had
moved toward the southwest and were
eagerly searching in a long line. As
we were proceeding in an opposite direction
we quickly left them. After
about five more minutes I would dare
to come to the surface. To the north
the way was clear.</p>

<p>Soon I was sitting, in the best of
spirits, up in the conning tower, greedily
inhaling with both lungs the fine, refreshing
sea air and, mixed with it, the
long puffs of the cigarette.</p>



<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></h2>

<h3>RICH SPOILS</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ate</span> in the afternoon of the same
day we broke into a peacefully
working fishing flotilla just like a wolf
into a flock of sheep. In order to be
sure no shepherd with his dog was
guarding them we, keeping ourselves
submerged, carefully examined each
ship. I could not see a gun or anything
suspicious anywhere.</p>

<p>All were peacefully occupied at their
casting nets, fishing. There were seven
fishing steamers and nine sailing ships,
which were scattered over a distance of
about three miles. The weather was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
glorious, even better than the day before.
The sun smiled from a steel blue
sky and danced in golden stripes on the
bright, calm surface of the sea. A gentle
northerly swell rocked the fishing
boats back and forth, so that the gaffs
and the frames on which the extra nets
had been stretched to dry were swinging
and banging.</p>

<p>Countless numbers of sea gulls were
flying about close to the flotilla. With
shrill cries and in thick flocks, they
swooped down on the sterns of some
isolated boats, and hurled themselves,
gliding on their wings, into the refuse
of the last catch which the fishermen
were throwing overboard.</p>

<p>The horizon stood out visibly from
the sea all around and seemed to be a
great shining, glittering ring. Not a
speck of cloud spotted its bright edges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Nothing was visible except our fishermen.</p>

<p>Hurrah, this was just the weather for
us! A rare and favorable opportunity
had presented itself here to play a trick
on the English fish market.</p>

<p>As a ghost, I suddenly arose behind
one of the fishing steamers, pushed the
conning tower hatch up, and jumped
up on the tower, holding the flag of war
in one hand and the megaphone in the
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halloo-o-o!&#8221;</p>

<p>The fishermen stared at us open
mouthed, rooted to the spot as if paralyzed
by fear of us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Halloo-o-o-o, Captain!&#8221; I shouted
for the second time. &#8220;I want to talk
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some time a figure emerged
from the crowd, stepped up the stairway,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and shouted some words that
were not very clear but which sounded
like:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>I summoned my best English and
told the red-nosed chap that I would
have to sink before sundown the whole
fleet of fishing boats, and furthermore
I told him that I had selected him to
take the crews of all the others aboard
his steamer. I added he must immediately
cut his nets and follow me at a
distance of five hundred meters, and
that I would promptly blow him to
pieces if he, of his own accord, attempted
to diminish this distance as I would
then surely believe he intended to ram
me.</p>

<p>The captain declared he was willing
to obey my commands, cut the nets, and
followed me. I ordered full speed ahead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and hoisted to the mast the following
signal:</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the boat immediately!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then I rushed in among the excited
swarm. With flashing eyes, the sailors
were standing by our guns and waiting,
lovingly fondling the shells, ready to
begin firing.</p>

<p>First we went right through the
crowd of fishing-boats and then along
the edges of the fleet, in order to prevent
the escape of the steamers furthest
away. Nowhere did we take the
time to stop to sink a ship, but only
drove the crews away from their boats.
Then the prey could not get away
from us.</p>

<p>How promptly the fishermen alighted
because of the fear of our shells! They
scrambled aboard the one steamer selected
to save them in such a rush it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
looked like a panicky flight. Soon cutters
and rowboats were swarming all
around us and speedily the steamer selected
to save the crews was crowded.</p>

<p>But even during such an exciting occupation
we did not neglect to keep a
sharp lookout, for under no circumstances
were we to be taken by surprise
when at this work. But it was easy to
look out over a great distance. The
horizon was free and clear.</p>

<p>As soon as the fishermen were safe
aboard the steamer, we began the sinking
of the ships and went from ship to
ship, stopped at a distance of a hundred
meters, and sent solid, well-aimed
shots at their water lines until they had
had enough and began to sink. Many
went down with the first shot. Others
were tougher and required four. For
the gun crew this was great sport. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
took turns and each jealously counted
the number of shots required for his
&#8220;fisherman.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the steamers were &#8220;fixed,&#8221; we
went to the sailing boats, which, in accordance
with their inveterate custom,
were lying huddled together. The
sailors generally needed only one shot&#8212;then
they capsized and sank into the
sea with a death gurgle. It was a
touching scene which, in spite of our
inner joy, was hard on our nerves, as
every true sailor regards the sailing-ship
as a remnant of romance, dying out
faster and faster in these days.</p>

<p>This was truly the reason why now
and at other times our hearts ached for
each sailing ship which we had to sink.
The surface was covered with hundreds
of thousands of dead fish which were
scattered over the sea. To countless sea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
gulls it was a highly welcome call to
dinner, which they eagerly accepted,
gorging themselves and filling themselves
so that their feathers stood
straight out from their bodies.</p>

<p>We had already sent thirteen ships
to the bottom, only two sailing-ships remaining
besides the rescue steamer. As
the opportunity was a rare one, I permitted
the firemen and men from the
engine room to come up on deck so that
they could see with their own eyes a
ship go down. I enjoyed hearing their
funny remarks and to watch how, in
their childish joy, they enthusiastically
greeted each new shot. I was glad to
see the bright color the fresh air and
excitement brought to their pale faces.
Gr&ouml;ning stepped up to me and said
thoughtfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;What will happen if the steamer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
goes to England and tells our position?
Following the events of yesterday afternoon,
this morning and now, the English
can easily figure out our course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, you are right there! I
had not happened to think of that. It
is indeed true that one gets duller as
the years go by. That must be prevented
under all circumstances, especially
on account of to-morrow. You
know what then&#8212;don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gr&ouml;ning nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, to-morrow we&#8217;ll have a trying
day,&#8221; I continued, &#8220;and, if we are going
to succeed, we can&#8217;t make conditions
any harder for ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was pondering the question of how
we were going to avoid the danger of
being betrayed by the fishermen without
endangering their lives, which I did not
want to do. I thought this over for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
moment. Suddenly I struck my forehead
with my hand and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;So stupidly foolish! One is never
able to think of the simplest way!&#8221; I
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll simply shift the entire
crowd to one of the sailing-ships. With
this light breeze, it will take them at
least three days to reach the coast and,
after that, it does not matter. It will be
a little crowded for so many people, but
that can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the provisions?&#8221; Gr&ouml;ning
asked. &#8220;What are they going to live
on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s simple,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;First
of all they can take off all the provisions
from the steamer and, besides
that, they have all the fish in the sailing-ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>I sank the smaller of the two sailboats
and then approached the steamer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
which had taken aboard the crews from
the other boats.</p>

<p>The captain of the steamer was bitterly
disappointed, of course, when I
brought him word that all hands would
have to go to the sailboat. He had been
so delighted to be the one chosen to keep
his steamer. On the other hand, to the
captain of the sailing-ship, the message
that he could go back to his old, faithful
smack came as a gift from heaven.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, joy and sorrow lie close
together and go hand in hand.</p>

<p>After a short half hour the shift was
made, and the steamer also went down
into the deep&#8212;the fifteenth ship within
two hours. First the skipper carefully
hauled up his nets and then with flapping
sails slowly swung around and laid
his course toward the west.</p>

<p>During the night we dropped down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
to the bottom of the ocean at X&#8212;&#8212;.
We wanted to get some rest for one
night and gather strength for the next
day. It is comfortable to lie in the soft
sands of the North Sea. It is as if the
whole boat went to bed. One thing
necessary for this comfort was a calm
surface, because a heavy sea is felt at a
great depth and throws and bangs the
boat back and forth on the bottom.</p>

<p>Slowly the boat slipped deeper and
deeper. We had taken soundings before
submerging. The nearer we came
to the bottom the slower the dynamo
motors worked, and I at last stopped
them entirely when we were a few
meters from the bottom. As soon as we
had stopped sinking, which could be
told by the fact the diving rudder was
no longer working, a few liters of water
were pumped into a ballast tank made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
for just this purpose. The boat became
heavier and slowly sunk further.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll soon strike,&#8221; I called
down to the &#8220;Centrale&#8221; and looked at
the manometer.</p>

<p>Hardly had the words left my lips
when we felt a very gentle shock&#8212;much
weaker than when a train stops&#8212;and
knew we were at the bottom. Some
more water was pumped into the ballast
tanks in order to make the boat steadier
and then each one at his post carefully
examined scuttles and hatchways so
that not a drop of water could leak
through to us. From bow to stern it
was reported:</p>

<p>&#8220;All is tight!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thereafter orders were given for the
necessary guards, and then I let the
crew leave their posts:</p>

<p>&#8220;All hands to be free to-night!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Until to-morrow on the bottom of the
ocean! No other restfulness can be
compared with it. Rest after so much
excitement which has stirred the emotions
of us all; after such a day&#8217;s work,
is it possible that any one can appreciate
how we enjoyed ourselves?</p>

<p>We did not care that we were not in
port and that a mountain of ocean was
over our heads. We felt as secure as
if we had been at the safest spot in the
world. From their posts the crew went
past us, with pale, oily, and dirty faces,
but with their eyes looking at me as
they went by, proud, happy, radiant,
so that my heart rejoiced.</p>

<p>There was some excitement among
the crew. Every one washed, talked
and laughed so that it was evident how
happy and care-free they felt.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, with what will you treat us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to-day?&#8221; I asked the cook who, with
great self-confidence&#8212;because he was
an expert in his line&#8212;was standing before
his little galley and stirring a
steaming pot. &#8220;That smells wonderfully
appetizing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ox goulash and salt potatoes,&#8221; answered
the cook and with more eagerness
stirred his pot. &#8220;It soon will be
ready. It&#8217;ll not take more than five
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must hurry up,&#8221; I replied,
and went to my small cabin, where I
had not put foot since five o&#8217;clock in
the morning.</p>

<p>I put my cap, long scarf and oil-skin
jacket on a hook, stretched myself in
weary delight and washed myself energetically.
This is a rare pleasure on a
trip like ours. From the nearby room
the happy talk of the officers reached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
my ears. I then heard a rattle of plates
and forks, a cork popped from a bottle,
and Gr&ouml;ning opened the little door that
separates my cabin from the room of the
other officers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Captain, dinner is ready,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Soon we were sitting, four men in all,
at a little, nicely decorated table, cutting
into the steaming platter and drinking
out of small seidels a magnificent
sparkling wine. The past day&#8217;s events
had to be moistened a little with the
best we had. This was our custom when
the fortunes of war smiled graciously
on us.</p>

<p>The electrical heating apparatus furnishes
all the heat needed, but it still
has the disadvantage that in the still,
unchanged air, the heat arises so that
the temperature at the floor is several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
degrees colder than at the ceiling. Even
in our heavy sea-boots, we felt it a little,
although, as a whole, we were warm and
contented. The phonograph played
continuously. The petty officers had
taken charge of it and played one native
song after another. What a thrill ran
through me! At once there was silence.
All talk stopped. German songs of
the Fatherland were sung deep down
at the bottom of the ocean right on
England&#8217;s coast. Inspired by the music,
our hearts were filled with enthusiasm
and a silent promise was made to
give everything for the Fatherland&#8212;to
become a scourge to the enemy and
damage him with all our might.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the dance music, operettas,
vaudeville songs, and ragtime
were played. These stirred up a buoyant
spirit. Especially there was much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
joy among the firemen and sailors in
the crew&#8217;s quarters. Funny songs could
be heard from that direction. Dirty
playing cards were dug out and soon
there was a real German skat game in
full swing.</p>

<p>During this time we, in the officers&#8217;
mess, raised our glasses and drank
toasts to one another and to the beautiful
U-boat: &#8220;Rich spoils! A happy
journey home! Long live the U-boat!&#8221;
That is the U-boat toast.</p>

<p>The boat was lying very still. It
didn&#8217;t seem to stir.</p>

<p>&#8220;What an original idea for an artist!&#8221;
said our engineer, who was poetically
inclined, as he leaned back in his chair
staring thoughtfully at the ceiling.
&#8220;One can imagine a cross section of the
boat showing our room at the North
Sea&#8217;s yellowish sand bottom, to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
all kinds of crawling and swimming animals
give life. In here four feasting,
happy officers around a little table on
which a warm electric light is shining
with the wine bottle in the center and
with the glasses raised to a solemn toast.
Above&#8212;water, water, water&#8212;water to
the height of a church steeple and, over
it all, the glittering heavens full of stars
and a small silver-white piece of the
moon. If I were a painter I should
immediately start with this motive for a
picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And give me the picture, I hope,&#8221;
I laughed. &#8220;And, after all, not such a
bad idea about that picture&#8212;one should
in reality propose such a motive to an
artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it would be possible to put
in a couple of mermaids who look in
through the conning tower window inquisitively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and knock with their fingers
on the glass,&#8221; said Petersen, our youngest
lieutenant, with a smile. &#8220;That
would undoubtedly make the picture
still more attractive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gr&ouml;ning, who during the entire time
had listened with a quiet smile to the
conversation, took out his empty cigar
holder, on which he always chewed when
we were under water because, as a heavy
smoker, he missed tobacco, as none of
us was allowed to smoke inside the boat.
Slowly he said with a touch of irony,
in a deep, sympathetic voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, my dear Petersen, you are an
unreasonable rascal. If there are no
women in the game, then there is no
pleasure for you. Doesn&#8217;t the fellow
actually talk about mermaids when he
tells us every fourth week he is going
to become engaged. &#8216;This time it&#8217;s absolutely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
certain! This time I surely will
do it, as I will never find such a girl
again.&#8217; This and more I hear every
month. What was the last one&#8217;s name
that you intended to make happy&#8212;your
March girl? Wait, I have it&#8212;the February
girl&#8212;ha, ha, ha&#8212;has the captain
heard the story of the February girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned to me laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you shut up, Gr&ouml;ning!&#8221; Petersen
burst forth and blushed up to his
ears. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you that if you tell tales
out of school&#8212;and besides&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Petersen,&#8221; I encouraged,
&#8220;what &#8216;besides&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, all that is not true,&#8221; he continued
and blushed still more when he
noticed that he had betrayed himself.
&#8220;<i>You</i> should certainly keep quiet,&#8221; he
went on suddenly, beaming with an
idea, and began to attack in order to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
lead the conversation away from himself.
&#8220;He who lives in glass houses
should be more careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8212;I&#8212;I&#8212;how so&#8212;that&#8217;s the limit!&#8221;
Gr&ouml;ning angrily rejoined, as he considered
it an honor to be known among his
friends as a woman hater. &#8220;I&#8212;in a
glass house? It&#8217;s a mean accusation, or
have you been drinking too much wine,
my dear boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah! only a glass,&#8221; answered the
younger officer, defending himself. &#8220;It
is ridiculous to claim anything like
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, be friends now, sirs,&#8221; I
said soothingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s quarrel
down here at the bottom of the sea. I
hereby decide that our younger officer
is absolutely sober, but that, even so, he
will not be allowed to let his April girl
with her fishtail come in here, as a punishment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
because he has jilted his February
girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this decision both these fighting
roosters (really the best friends in the
world) had to be pleased, and the eternal
discussion of Eve and her daughters,
which had nearly made the ocean bottom
shake under our feet, was ended.</p>

<p>Shortly after this we went to bed in
our narrow bunks&#8212;for the first time
undressed on the voyage&#8212;and soon enjoyed
a sleep free from dreams.</p>



<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></h2>

<h3>THE WITCH-KETTLE</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the morning no rooster crowed to
wake me. But, instead, there stood
my faithful orderly, the Pole, Tuczynski,
before my bed, and loudly announced:</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Captain Lieutenant, it&#8217;s five-thirty!&#8221;</p>

<p>I woke up in bewilderment. My head
was still dull after a sound sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s five-thirty,&#8221; repeated the orderly.
&#8220;The water for washing and the
clothes are ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah! Like a flash the reality was before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
me. We were lying on the bottom
of the sea&#8212;were going to arise within
an hour&#8212;and then we were going
to&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>I leaped out of bed. The thought of
&#8220;then we were going to&#8221; fully awoke
me. &#8220;Yes, we are going to go at it;
everything depends upon to-day,&#8221; I
thought, and put my feet into my slippers.</p>

<p>Hardly had I scrambled to my feet
when I had to grasp the closet to support
myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up now?&#8221; I asked, turning
to my good Pole, who was spitting on
my left boot in order to preserve the
shine. &#8220;We are rolling. What&#8217;s happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be a little sea above,&#8221; he replied
with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand that myself, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
smarty, but when did it start? Run
along quickly and find out when the
rolling was first noticed!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tuczynski hurried to the &#8220;Centrale&#8221;
and returned immediately with his
answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;About two o&#8217;clock, says Lieutenant
Petersen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then we must have a considerable
storm above, if the wind has been
blowing for four hours. Get out my
oil-skin coat quickly! It will be needed
to-day,&#8221; I ordered, and hurriedly
dressed myself as water-tight as possible.</p>

<p>The change of weather did not suit
my purpose, for, although to judge
from the motion of the boat the storm
was not as yet so bad, the strength of
the wind was probably six, and it was
gradually becoming worse. At this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
time of the year storms could be terrible.</p>

<p>&#8220;Devil take the luck&#8212;and this very
day, too!&#8221; I swore through my six-day
old beard-stub.</p>

<p>After breakfast I called the entire
crew together. &#8220;Boys,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you
know that we have many things unaccomplished.
As yet we are only at the
beginning of our task. Yesterday and
the day before we were very successful,
and now we have had a restful night.
Being well rested, we are now cheerfully
and confidently ready for another
day&#8217;s work. To-day we are going to
go through the so-called &#8216;Witch-Kettle.&#8217;
You all know what I mean, and you
know also that this is not child&#8217;s play.
The enemy there is keeping sharp lookout,
but we will keep a better lookout.
Others have gotten through before us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Consequently, we will also get through,
if each one of you sticks to his post and
does his duty as well as you all have
done hitherto. This I expect from
every man. And now&#8212;to the diving
stations!&#8221;</p>

<p>I went up to the tower. Shortly after
the engineer reported from the &#8220;Centrale&#8221;:</p>

<p>&#8220;All hands are at the diving station!&#8221;</p>

<p>Consequently we were ready for our
task. The day began&#8212;the most remarkable
day of my life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arise!&#8221;</p>

<p>The pump began to buzz. We now
had to empty the ballast-tanks of the
water which had been taken in to make
the boat heavier, in order that, instead
of being held down, we should begin to
pull ourselves loose, and drift slowly
upwards. Usually that man&#339;uver was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
accomplished with the best of success,
but not so to-day. The boat wabbled
and &#8220;stuck,&#8221; as we used to say. It
called to my mind the question which
is often asked by laymen: &#8220;Are you
never in fear of not being able to get
up to the surface again?&#8221; We, of
course, had no fear, but I knocked impatiently
on the manometer to see if the
register would not at last begin to move.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nine hundred liters above the normal,&#8221;
Kr&uuml;ger reported from the &#8220;Centrale.&#8221;</p>

<p>It meant that we had pumped out of
the boat nine hundred liters more than
the normal quantity necessary to make
the boat rise.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems as if we were fastened in a
vise,&#8221; I joked, &#8220;but in accordance with
the map there ought to be a sand bottom
here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it loosens!&#8221; the engineer called
out.</p>

<p>Yes, the boat pulled loose all right&#8212;the
hand on the manometer was rising&#8212;but
it shot upwards on one side only.
The stern arose but the nose remained
fastened in the mud.</p>

<p>&#8220;How confoundedly nasty,&#8221; I heard
Gr&ouml;ning, who took care of the diving
rudder, growl.</p>

<p>Now the entire ballast shifted. We
had to make the boat heavier in the
stern, had to shift the ballast of the
heretofore well-balanced boat and pump
ballast water out of the bow to pour
water into the stern tanks, in order to
make the bow lighter and the stern
heavier. After a few liters of water had
exchanged places the boat changed her
mind and again placed herself in a horizontal
position. Then she arose quickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and satisfactorily, but showed a tendency
to list toward the stern, until we,
by a new shift of the ballast, had re-established
the old conditions of equilibrium.</p>

<p>After the boat had pulled loose with
apparent reluctance from her bed on the
bottom, she could not get up fast
enough to stick her nose into the fresh
air. Having the ballast diminished by
nine hundred liters, she leaped upwards
rapidly, but this did not suit my purpose,
as I preferred first to put up the
periscope and find out whether the
atmosphere was free from British
germs. As I felt I was entirely responsible
for my boat&#8217;s health, I entertained
one fear, based on experience, that
germs in the form of destroyers and
trawlers, appearing suddenly, might endanger
it. I made the boat obey my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
will, let the nine hundred liters be
pumped into her again, and thus
checked her quick ascent.</p>

<p>At the same time I had the dynamo
motors started, so that we would have
steerageway for the diving rudder, and
commanded that the U-boat should
stop at the depth of twenty meters.
Thereafter, I soon came to the periscope
depth and took a look around to see if
I could discover any ships. There was
nothing in sight, but woe&#8212;a heavy
storm!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it can&#8217;t be helped,&#8221; I said
softly to myself.</p>

<p>I made another careful search of the
horizon and then arose entirely to the
surface. What a delightful sensation
to be standing on the tower with my
hands to my sides and greedily sucking
my lungs full of the fresh sea air! The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
air at the bottom had not been so bad.
On the contrary, the engineers had kept
it in first-class condition during the
night, but more delightful was the wonderful
ocean air.</p>

<p>Now the ventilator burst open and refreshed
those inside with fresh air
throughout the ship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mate,&#8221; I ordered, &#8220;let me take
a look at the map once more. That&#8217;s
right. Put it right up here on the tower&#8212;no
harm done if it gets wet. Now
let&#8217;s have a compass and a lead pencil&#8212;thanks.
Watch carefully and follow
my calculations to see I make no mistake.
From here to the first mine field
it is twenty-two miles; from there to
the second mine field about fourteen
miles&#8212;which makes thirty-six miles altogether.
We must reach the first field
just before the ebb tide, as the mines are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
only visible just before or right after
the ebb tide. We get the ebb about ten
o&#8217;clock, and it is now half past six. We
can, therefore, go along easily at half
speed and will have enough time
to recharge the batteries. Is that
right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right,&#8221; replied the mate,
and quickly folded up the map, which he
had shown anxiety in guarding, time
and time again, against the waves washing
over the ship, &#8220;if we only don&#8217;t have
to dive again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe we will,&#8221; I said with
confidence. &#8220;Here near the mine fields
I think there are few ships sailing. So
far as that goes, we are really safer here.
The scouting will be on the other side of
the fields.&#8221;</p>

<p>Exactly one hour before the ebb tide
we reached those sections where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
enemy, according to the reports from
other U-boats, believed that they had
effectively blocked the passage with a
mine field that stretched for several
miles. I say &#8220;believed,&#8221; because the
mines, as before stated, were showing
above the surface during the ebb tide
and one could easily steer through the
lanes between them. The blocking of
this important passage was therefore
for the enemy an assuring but somewhat
expensive illusion. It was not
quite so easy as I had expected from the
stories and reports of my fellow submarine
commanders to slip between the
mines.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sirs, here it goes!&#8221; I said to
both officers, who, like me, had crawled
into their thick oil-skins and had exchanged
their caps, embroidered with
gold oak leaves, for the practical southwester.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
&#8220;Now, we&#8217;ll see who spots the
first mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a drizzle of foam and spray we
were standing side by side and gazed at
the sea several hundred meters ahead
of us. The ocean had within the last
few hours become still heavier and
stormier, and the wind came from the
southwest and consequently straight
toward us so that there was danger of
discovering the mines too late, as they
would be concealed from our sight with
every roll of the sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly we all three looked at one
another and then quickly at the sea
again. There they were! Heavens,
what a bunch! In all directions as far
as the eye could see were the devilish
dark globes, washed with the breakers&#8217;
snow-white foam. We were so overwhelmed
by the sight of all these mines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
that we started to swear and kept it up
for some time without any interruption.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s outrageous! It&#8217;s unheard of!
It&#8217;s terrible! Such a mass! And such a
people call themselves Christian seafarers&#8212;a
bunch of murderers, that&#8217;s
what they are, who can put out such
dirty traps!&#8221;</p>

<p>With reduced speed we went toward
the &#8220;caviar sandwich,&#8221; as Petersen
called the dark spotted surface before
us. Now it was &#8220;up to&#8221; us skilfully to
steer the boat between the irregularly
spread mines and see carefully to it that
we did not get into a blind alley. If
only our boat did not hit one of those
devilish things! It would be the end of
us! But surely if we kept calm, we
should get through all right. Certainly
we would. We had a warhelmsman
who was a wonder in his line, boatswain&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
mate Lohmann. He could
thank his skill as a helmsman for his
long career in the navy. If he was up
to some deviltry&#8212;which, it is said,
rather often happened in former days&#8212;it
was always mentioned as an extenuating
circumstance&#8212;&#8220;but he&#8217;s such an
able helmsman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lohmann, when he put his mind to it,
could certainly steer. He could hit a
floating cork with the prow. He was
standing with feet apart in the tower
and grinning so that his mouth reached
from ear to ear. He always grinned
when he stood at the wheel. But now
that he had become the most important
person on board, he was radiating joy
and pride to such an extent that his
little square figure took on a superior
pose of careless daring. With his
right hand he spun the wheel playfully,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
just as if he were experimenting. He
had shoved the other deep down into the
large pocket of his seaman&#8217;s trousers
clear up to his elbow.</p>

<p>Then we were pounding into the
mine field. Lohmann squinted together
his small gray eyes to a couple of narrow
slits, spat first in his right hand,
and then in a long semi-circle towards
the first mine which we were just passing
on the port side. He, thereupon,
hitched his slipping trousers, lit his nose-warmer&#8212;a
pipe broken off close to the
bowl&#8212;spat once more into his right
hand, and began a series of artistic curvings
and twistings to weave his way
through the narrow lanes. And he was
as calm and confident as if he had done
nothing all his life except steer U-boats
through mine fields. I could leave him
in charge of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>After ten minutes we had passed the
mine field. We estimated we had sifted
through about eight hundred mines.</p>

<p>At high speed we then steered toward
the second batch of mines.</p>

<p>Then came a series of reverses which
made this the most eventful day so far
experienced by any U-boat crew in the
war.</p>

<p>It was ten forty-two by the clock.</p>

<p>Beyond the second mine field an English
destroyer was patrolling. We had
to dive quickly and go through the
mines under the water, a detested and
very dangerous proceeding!</p>

<p>The destroyer had not seen us. The
sea became more violent; the barometer
fell rapidly; the heaven was filled with
black rain clouds. The clearness of the
atmosphere disappeared, and the ocean
was restless and covered with white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
foam. The sea washed over the periscope
again and again with white-combed,
rushing mountains of water, so
that for several long seconds I could
see nothing. Suddenly we were in the
midst of the mines. I could make out
those that were close by, because the
water had risen so that only the tops of
the black balls, which here and there
bobbed up for a second, could be seen.</p>

<p>To turn away from the mines at the
right moment was almost impossible.
We were running straight for a mine&#8212;the
next second it was on top of us and
passed only a few meters from the periscope.
At the same time, on the other
side, three mines clustered together in
a group were floating past us. It was a
hellish journey, and the destroyer was
all the time waiting for us on the other
side of the mine field, and compelled us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to continue below the surface. He had
no consideration for our difficulties.</p>

<p>Oh, how he would enjoy it if we suddenly
went up in the air, surrounded by
a cloud of smoke and fire! Good God!
Now we are about to give him this joy.
I had already shut my eyes and thought
we were doomed&#8212;because one of the
mines had just struck hard with a metallic
clang against the periscope, a sound
which I will never forget until I am in
a better world! But the mine, which I
saw just before the wave washed over
the periscope, had been carried away behind
us and had better sense than to
blow us up; it only twisted on its axis
and didn&#8217;t do us any harm. Maybe it
was old and damaged.</p>

<p>I could not stand it any longer. I
felt like a man trying to commit suicide
when he misses his aim.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Quickly dive to twenty-five meters!&#8221;
I called down to the &#8220;Centrale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rather dash blindly through this hell
than always see your last minute right
before your eyes, and still be unable to
do anything. But if, while submerged,
a cable should fasten itself around the
U-boat? The chance of getting through
was better down there, I figured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Start the phonograph,&#8221; I commanded,
&#8220;and put on something cheerful, if
you please!&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the new, beautiful &#8220;Field
Gray Uniforms,&#8221; the song which soon
resounded through the boat, I heard
twice a hellish grinding and scraping
above the conning tower&#8212;mine cables
which we had fouled. At last, after
many long minutes, we were through
the mine field. We arose and I put up
the periscope and looked around. God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
be praised! The atmosphere, or rather
the water, was clearer. The destroyer
was several hundred meters behind us,
and we had come through the horrible
place without a scratch.</p>

<p>Aha! There was the first buoy&#8212;the
first placed on the narrow sand bar.
Now it was careful steering for the ship.
We took soundings and proceeded cautiously.
If only the current had not
been so strong! It constantly swung
us out of our course. I had to steer
against the current continually.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mate, how far are we now from
land?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor quickly brought up the
chart and measured the distance with a
scale.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two and a half sea miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the devil! And, as yet, we cannot
see anything of it. The air has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
thickening. That&#8217;s all we need to make
things worse for us!&#8221;</p>

<p>The cruiser on guard now came rushing
past us on the port side. It was
not far from us when I pulled down the
periscope for a time.</p>

<p>Who can describe my fright when I
put up the periscope again in a few minutes
and could not see anything because
of the fog that had settled down on the
sea! A dark rainwall also moved along
the surface. And this was just where
it was absolutely necessary for me to
see. I must see where the channel began
to be very narrow! Only one narrow
passage about two hundred meters
wide, there was, within which we absolutely
must proceed. Every turn away
from this&#8212;either to the right or left&#8212;would
immediately run us into the sandbank.
And now there was no sign of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the buoy which marked the channel. In
addition to this we faced a current we
had not counted on.</p>

<p>I searched and searched for the buoy.
The sweat stood out on my forehead,
and the excitement made me so warm
that the sights on the periscope time
and time again clouded up on account
of the heat from my body. The mate
must continually wipe the wet glass
with a piece of chamois.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we should be off the buoy,
Mate, but I don&#8217;t see it! Good God,
what are we going to do! It will be
fatal&#8212;it is impossible to navigate without
picking it up. And besides, the
destroyer which is lurking behind that
confounded rainwall and which at any
minute can come up alongside us!&#8221;</p>

<p>The buoy did not appear.</p>

<p>Then the weather began to clear up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
The rain thinned and the fog lifted a
little.</p>

<p>First we saw land. Thereafter we
saw the destroyer at quite a distance on
the port side, laying a course towards
us, and then&#8212;then&#8212;&#8212;</p>

<p>All good spirits have mercy on us!</p>

<p>The buoy&#8212;our buoy&#8212;was to the
wrong side.</p>

<p>And we? Great God in Heaven&#8212;we
were going on the wrong course!
We were running right for the sandbank.
We must already be right on top
of them. Disastrously for us, it has
cleared too late.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard a-starboard! Reverse both
engines full speed!&#8221; There was nothing
more to do. Then came the disaster!
A jar and a whirring&#8212;U-boat 202 had
gone aground.</p>



<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></h2>

<h3>A DAY OF TERROR</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat</span> we went through was horrible.
The breakers dashed
high over the sandbar. They hurled
themselves on us to destroy our boat,
played ball with us, lifted us high into
the air and dropped us again on the bar
with such fury that the whole boat shivered
and trembled.</p>

<p>We had lost control of the boat completely.
The roaring breakers made so
much noise we could hear them through
the thick metal wall. Every new, onrushing
wave tossed us higher and
higher on the reef. Exposure was our
greatest danger. Already the top of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the conning tower and the prow projected
above the surface&#8212;but a moment
more and the entire boat would be
plainly visible. Then we would surely
be lost. As a helpless wreck, we would
become a target for the destroyer.</p>

<p>Pale and calm, every man stuck to
his post and clung to the nearest support,
so as not to fall at the rolling and
jolting of the boat. With awe, I looked
alternately at the manometer and the
feverish sea which I could see all around
me through the conning tower windows.
Oh, if it had been only the sea we must
fear! But through the scum and froth,
more merciless than the wild, onrushing
breakers, the black destroyer, smoking
copiously, steamed straight toward us,
like a bull with lowered horns.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had better keep below the water
at any price, even if we are smashed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
pieces against the sandbank and the boat
breaks up, rather than to be blown to
pieces by the shells of the English,&#8221; was
the thought that flashed through my
brain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fill the ballast tanks,&#8221; I called down
to the &#8220;Centrale.&#8221; &#8220;Fill all the tanks
full, Herr Engineer. Do you hear?
We must not under any circumstances
rise any higher!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ballast tanks filling!&#8221; it was reported
from below.</p>

<p>Oh, how quiet it was below! Not a
word was uttered. No anxious conjectures,
no surmises, and no questions.</p>

<p>A deep, irresistible grief clutched my
heart. My poor little boat! My poor
crew! There every man unflinchingly
and unhesitatingly did his duty, and
devotedly put his faith in me. They
were all heroes, so young and still so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
brave and able. And I, the commander,
had brought them into the very mouth
of death, and to me, the only one who
could see our desperate situation, it
seemed as if the scale of death slowly
weighed against us, because the destroyer,
with horrible certainty, was approaching.
His sharp prow pointed directly
towards us. Soon he would discover
the projecting parts of our tower
and prow, which the breakers treacherously
washed over, and then we would
be lost. Soon a hail of shells would
sweep over us, and the greedy, foaming
sea would roaringly hurl itself through
the open holes in our sides.</p>

<p>The filling of the ballast tanks had
the desired effect. The boat lay down
heavily on the reef and spurred the wild
waves to greater efforts, and, though
we did not rise any farther, the jolting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
increased in violence because of its
added weight. It was a wonder that the
boat did not go to pieces like an egg
shell, and we all looked at one another
in surprise when, after a terrific jolt,
nothing more occurred than the bursting
of a few electric bulbs. &#8220;First-class
material,&#8221; I thought to myself.</p>

<p>The mate who, over my shoulder, was
keeping watch on the destroyer through
the window on the port side, suddenly
said, in his hearty, Saxon dialect:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well! Where does he intend
to look for us now, I wonder? At any
rate, he doesn&#8217;t think that we are stuck
here among the breakers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mate, you old optimist. Those
words I&#8217;ll never forget. Great God!
If you are right! Then certainly&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is already turning,&#8221; the little
chap cut me short, and jammed his nose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
against the window-glass, so as to be
able to see better.</p>

<p>I grabbed him by the neck and pulled
him away, as my blood rushed to my
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? What is it you are saying?
Is he turning&#8212;good God in heaven&#8212;yes,
it&#8217;s true&#8212;he really <i>is</i> turning, all
the time turning&#8212;now his broadside
swings round towards us, now his stern&#8212;he
has turned&#8212;he is departing. He
has not seen us, he has not seen us!&#8221;</p>

<p>I remember that once, when I was a
little boy, I got a roe-deer as a present.</p>

<p>I loved it a great deal and we were
inseparable. It had to sleep on a rug
by my bed. One beautiful summer&#8217;s
day we were playing in the sun on a
large lawn before the house when suddenly
a large, unknown hound came
rushing towards my little pet and blood-thirstily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
chased it around the lawn. The
nasty dog was about to run it down
when my pet, with a shrill shriek, appealed
for help. I was standing paralyzed
in terror and could not get a word
through my lips, when unexpectedly the
owner called the dog back with a
whistle. Then I threw myself, with
great exultation, down alongside my
pet, pressed it to my heart, kissed its
black snoot, and cried and laughed with
joy.</p>

<p>Those were my feelings now, when,
with my own eyes, I saw the impossible&#8212;that
the destroyer, without suspecting
our presence, had steered away from us.
Was it possible that he did not see us,
when, according to my estimation, he
was only about eight hundred meters
away? Could the mate be right, and
the foolish destroyer have only searched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the passage in accordance with his
schedule? &#8220;But,&#8221; I thought, with a
shiver, &#8220;how easily would not perchance
a glance in our direction have betrayed
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Radiant with joy, I told the crew in
the &#8220;Centrale&#8221; what a happy turn the
affairs had taken at the last moment.
A burden must have fallen from the
hearts of my splendid, brave boys.</p>

<p>I then revealed my plans to the engineer:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to lie here until the
destroyer reaches the other end of his
patrol, which is about three to four sea
miles from here. Then, at once, quickly
empty all the tanks so that the boat cuts
loose from the reef. At top speed, we
will make for deep water and then dive
again to a safe position below the surface.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Again a light rain-cloud floated
slowly towards us and favored our
plans. Soon the destroyer could be seen
only as a fading figure in the mist. Now
we could risk to arise and get away
from our other danger&#8212;the fiercely
rolling breakers.</p>

<p>The valves were quickly opened. At
once the boat came up. The terrific
jolting ceased. The hand of the
manometer moved upwards, and, after
a few seconds, the boat&#8217;s broad, dripping
back broke through the surface.</p>

<p>There is the buoy! Now full speed
ahead! We&#8217;ll be soon there&#8212;now but
a few hundred meters more and then
the game is ours&#8212;a game on which life
and death depended; a game which
would have turned our hair white if we
had not been so young, and if we had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
not, through horrible dangers, been
united by true and faithful bonds.</p>

<p>As soon as we had placed ourselves
on the right side of the longed-for buoy
we again hurled ourselves deep down
into the cool sea as happily as a fish
which for a long time had been on dry
land, and suddenly gets into its own element
again.</p>

<p>The first and most dangerous part of
our journey through the &#8220;Witch-Kettle&#8221;
was over, although not without its
horrible experiences. The narrow inlet
was passed and also the several sea
miles, wide and free from reefs and
other navigation difficulties. Thus we
merrily glided about in the deep and, in
good spirits, hammered and listened and
felt our splendid, hard-tried, heavily-tested
boat all over back and forth, to
see if it had pulled through without a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
leak from the pit of the rolling breakers;
and we soon all forgot. As long as
the nerves were at a continuous tension
we had no time to think about past
events. And though we had happily
passed through and over mines and
reefs, still the day was far from ended,
and our main task was still before
us.</p>

<p>This day continually brought us new
and unexpected surprises, so that, at
last, we had a gruesome feeling that
everything had united itself for our destruction.
First there were the trawlers;
then the motor boats, which in pairs,
with a steel net between them, searched
through the channel where they suspected
that U-boats were lurking.
Every time we stuck up our periscope
cautiously in order to look around a
bit, it never failed that we had one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
those searching parties right in front of
us, so that we must submerge in a hurry
to a greater depth in order not to be
caught by the dangerous nets. And if
for a short time there was an opportunity
to scan the horizon undisturbed,
then the atmosphere was thick, and we
were unable to locate the shores, which
we knew were close at hand, so that at
last we hardly knew where we were, as
the currents in these parts could not be
estimated. Since the famous buoy we
had not seen any mark which would
in any degree assist us to locate ourselves.</p>

<p>We kept to our course up the center
of the channel and trusted that our
lucky star would lead us straight.
Every half hour we came up from the
safety of the deep and tried to take our
bearings and then submerged again, disappointed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
The crew, of course, must
remain at the diving stations uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>About two o&#8217;clock the cook came
around with pea-soup and pork in small
tin cups. He also stretched up his arms
to us in the conning tower with a steaming
plate in his hands. I put the plate
on my knees and dipped out its contents,
thinking &#8220;The wild beasts are
fed.&#8221; The moisture, which forms in
large drops on the ceiling during long
trips under the water, fell down on my
head and into my plate and left small
splotches of oil in the pea-soup as a sign
they were real drops of U-boat sweat.</p>

<p>We again arose to the periscope level
at four o&#8217;clock. At a distance of five
hundred meters, a scouting fleet was
moving about. At the same time on
our starboard bow a French torpedo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
boat with four funnels was cruising
around.</p>

<p>I had a desire to fire a shot at this
enemy, but the fact that such a shot
would send the whole lurking fleet at
us restrained me.</p>

<p>I have to admit that it was hard to
hold back from taking the chance, and
it was with a heavy heart that I gave
orders to dive again. But this, however,
saved us. If we had traveled at
the periscope level for only a few minutes
more, I would not be sitting here
to-day, smoking my cigar and writing
down the story of our adventures.</p>

<p>We were submerging, and the manometer
showed seventeen meters. Then,
suddenly, it was as if some one had hit
each one of us at the same minute with
a hammer. We all were unconscious for
a second and found ourselves on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
floor or thrown prone in some corner
with our heads, shoulders, and other
parts of our bodies in great pain. The
whole boat shook and trembled. Were
we still alive or what had happened?
Why was it so dark all around us? The
electric lights had gone out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look to the fuse!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put in the reserve fuse!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly we had our lights again.
All this happened within a few seconds
and more quickly than I can tell
it.</p>

<p>What had happened? Was it true we
were lost? Would the water rush into
the ship and pull us to the bottom? It
must be a mine&#8212;a violent mine detonation
had shaken us close by the boat.
And the U-202? What were the consequences
of this to the U-boat?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The reports came from all quarters:</p>

<p>&#8220;The bow compartment is tight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The stern compartments tight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The engine room all safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the boat unexpectedly began to
list. The bow sunk, and the stern
arose. The ship careened violently, although
the diving rudder was set hard
against this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Captain,&#8221; Gr&ouml;ning, who was
in charge of the diving rudder, shouted,
&#8220;something has happened. The boat
does not obey the rudder. We must
have gotten hooked into some trap&#8212;a
line or maybe a net. It&#8217;s hell. That&#8217;s
all that&#8217;s needed. We are jammed into
some net, and all around us the mines
are lining it. It&#8217;s enough to set you
crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; I called down. &#8220;We must
go through it. Put the diving rudder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
down hard! Both engines full speed
ahead! On no condition must we rise!
We must stay down at all costs. All
around above us are mines!&#8221;</p>

<p>The engines were going at top speed.
The boat shot upwards and then bent
down, ripped into the net, jerked, pulled
and tore and tore until the steel net
gave way from the force of the attack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! We are through it! The
boat obeys her diving rudder!&#8221; Gr&ouml;ning
called out from below. &#8220;The U-202
goes on her way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Down, keep her down all the time.
Dive to a depth of fifty meters,&#8221; I commanded.
&#8220;This is a horrible place&#8212;a
real hell!&#8221;</p>

<p>I bent forward and put my head
into my hands. It was rocking as if
being hit by a trip hammer. My forehead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
ached as if pricked with needles
and my ears buzzed so that I had to
press my fingers into them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a horrible place,&#8221; I repeated to
myself. &#8220;And what luck we had, what
a peculiar chance and wonderful escape
that we got out at all!&#8221;</p>

<p>It took some time for my aching head
to remember chronologically what had
happened. Yes, it certainly was lucky
that we, at the right moment, had submerged
deep. We had been at a depth
of about seventeen meters when our
prow collided with the net, and the detonation
followed. The more I thought
of it, the plainer everything became to
me.</p>

<p>As we had run against the net, it had
stretched and that had set off the mine.
The mines are set in the nets at the
height at which the U-boats generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
travel, which is the periscope level. If
we had tried to attack the torpedo boat
or, for any other reason, had remained
for a few minutes more at the periscope
level, we would have run into the net at
a point where our enemies had hoped we
would&#8212;namely, so that the mine would
have exploded right under us. Now the
mine, on the contrary, exploded above
us, and its entire strength went in the
direction where the natural resistance
was smallest&#8212;which was upwards.
Without causing us any greater damage
than a fright and a few possible scars
on the thin metal parts, which might
have scratched the paint, we had escaped.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Frenchman was
filled with exultation over our destruction
when, waiting at his post by the
net, he heard and saw the explosion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and probably reported by wireless to
the entire world:</p>

<p>&#8220;Enemy U-boat caught and destroyed
in a net by a mine explosion.&#8221;</p>

<p>And little I begrudge him that joy
if he, as a return favor in the future,
will leave us alone, because we had gotten
pretty nearly all we wanted, as it
was.</p>

<p>The day&#8217;s experiences were far from
ended. First Engineer Kr&uuml;ger appeared
on the stairway to the conning
tower with a troubled look.</p>

<p>&#8220;Herr Captain,&#8221; he reported, &#8220;we
must have gotten something in the propeller.
Our electric power is being consumed
twice as fast as it should. I suppose
that pieces of the metal net have
entangled themselves in the blades. The
laboring of the engines is terrific and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the charge in the batteries is being rapidly
reduced, and they are becoming exhausted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Were we now going to have this difficulty,
too! We had already consumed
a large quantity of the current, because
we had been compelled to dive at our
highest speed and this uses up the batteries
fast.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far can we go on it now, Herr
Kr&uuml;ger?&#8221;</p>

<p>The engineer calculated in his notebook,
shrugged his shoulders thoughtfully,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If we do not consume it any faster,
it should last us for a couple of hours
yet. It would be better, however, to
decrease our speed a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>I pondered this situation for a time.
In about an hour the tide would turn
and the current would be against us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
We would not be able to make much
speed then, but, on the other hand, it
would be dark, and we would probably
dare to rise to the surface. The enemy
undoubtedly believed we had perished
and would have decreased his vigilance.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; replied the engineer.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll stop one motor. There is no
danger we will run aground. It is too
deep here for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Consequently, we stopped one motor,
and continued ahead at a reduced speed.
At exactly five o&#8217;clock we came up
again to look around. Hard by in our
wake was the French torpedo boat
steaming at a distance of about two hundred
meters.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is it now?&#8221; I said to the
mate, and bit nervously on my lower lip.
&#8220;It looks as if that rascal was after
us.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be a coincidence,&#8221; answered
the unperturbed optimist.</p>

<p>We submerged once more, but came
up again after another half hour.</p>

<p>The torpedo boat still came after us,
steaming along in our wake at a distance
of two hundred meters.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this is a coincidence, Mate, then
it is a very, very peculiar one,&#8221; I said
to him.</p>

<p>When it was six o&#8217;clock we again
took a look around. The Frenchman
was still after us at the same distance.</p>

<p>&#8220;The devil! This is no coincidence!
I&#8217;ll be hanged if this is a coincidence.
This is intentional. We are certainly
pursued!&#8221;</p>

<p>There must be something the matter
with us. The enemy must be able to
follow us&#8212;there must be some sign that
enables him to follow us even when submerged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to a great depth. What could
it be?</p>

<p>I was pondering this impossible problem.
The only thing I could think of
was that when the mine exploded, it had
caused a leakage in one of our oil tanks
and that the escaping oil left a plain
trail that betrayed our presence. It was
impossible at any rate on account of our
slow speed under the water, against the
current, that by a coincidence and without
knowing about it, the Frenchman
kept coming after us at the same precise
distance. I had to find out about it.
We submerged once more, changed our
course, and proceeded at full speed. If
the Frenchman had really been able to
see anything of us, then he would also
follow us now when we changed our
course and were going four times as
fast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>At half past six I looked astern
through the periscope and again saw,
just as at five, half past five, and six,
the Frenchman who, at the same speed
on a changed course, continued to follow
us.</p>



<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></h2>

<h3>A LIVELY CHASE</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> fact that the French destroyer
continually followed us at the
same distance made me certain. There
was no doubt about it. We had been
discovered and were pursued. Soon the
Frenchman would call for aid and would
have all the bloodhounds of the sea on
our scent and following us. By this
time our storage batteries had begun
to be exhausted, and the water was a
hundred meters deep so that it was impossible
for us to lie on the bottom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice prospects,&#8221; I thought to myself.
To the mate and crew in the &#8220;Centrale,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>&#8221;
I called loudly so that all could
hear me:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now we have gotten rid of
him at last. Didn&#8217;t I say it was only
a coincidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>I wanted to relieve the tension on the
nerves of the men, because I knew how
they had gone on for days at a high pitch
of excitement.</p>

<p>In my plans, I had counted on the
darkness, which must come soon. We
would be very economical of the power,
so that it would take us to the point
which I had selected after carefully
studying the chart. We kept to the
same course for half an hour. Then,
when the darkness must have settled
down, I turned off at an angle of ninety
degrees, and headed straight for the
coast, where I knew the depth would
permit us to rest on the bottom, to wait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
until the enemy had given up his manhunt.
This would be towards morning,
I thought, especially if the storm coming
up from the southwest should increase
in violence so that the searching
of the water with nets would become
very difficult.</p>

<p>The point that I had selected for our
resting place was far from comfortable.
And it was marked on the chart, not
with the reassuring &#8220;Sd.&#8221; which indicated
a sand bottom, but with the
dreaded &#8220;St.&#8221; which meant the bottom
was stony. But we had no choice. And
when the devil is in a pinch, he will eat
flies, although he is accustomed to better
food. We did not rise again, since we
knew it was dark over the sea, but continued
at a considerable depth without
incident and slowly approached our
goal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>About midnight, according to my calculations,
we would be able to touch the
bottom. And the storage batteries had
to last up to that time. Kr&uuml;ger figured
and figured and came to the conclusion
that they would hardly last long
enough.</p>

<p>Until ten o&#8217;clock we had heard our
friend&#8217;s propellers over us several times.
Thereafter all became quiet on the surface,
and, relieved, I drew a deep breath.
They had lost the scent. It became
bearable again in the U-boat. I sat on
the stairway leading to the &#8220;Centrale&#8221;
and was eating sandwiches and drinking
hot tea with the other officers and the
rest of the crew. It was almost twelve
o&#8217;clock and still we had not touched bottom.
What would happen if the computation
of our location was wrong?
This could easily have occurred, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of the strong current and our slow
speed.</p>

<p>Half-past twelve! Still no bottom!
Engineer Kr&uuml;ger was nervously stamping
his feet and turned out one electric
light after another in order to save
power. For the same reason, the electric
heating apparatus had been cut off
for a long time, and we were very
cold.</p>

<p>At five minutes to one we felt a
slight scraping. The motors were
stopped and then we reversed them in
order to decrease our speed. A slight
jolt! We filled the ballast tanks and
were lying on the bottom where we
could wait for morning at our ease.
Who thought that? He who imagined
that we would have any rest was disappointed.
We were lying on a rock,
and the tide turned about two o&#8217;clock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and the southwest wind swept the sea
fiercely.</p>

<p>At the beginning, it seemed as if we
would be all right, down there on the
&#8220;St.&#8221; bottom, but we soon discovered
differently&#8212;when the rolling began.
There was no chance of gentle resting,
as on the soft sand of the North Sea,
but, instead, we banged and racked
from one rock to another, so it was a
wonder the boat could stand it at all.</p>

<p>Sometimes it sounded as if large
stones were rolling on deck and, again,
our boat would fall three or four meters
deeper with a jolt, so that the manometer
was never at rest, and we had to
stand this continued rising and falling
between twenty-two and thirty-eight
meters.</p>

<p>At last, towards four o&#8217;clock, we gave
it up. At some of the joints in the ship,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
there were small leakages, and none of
us had any thought of sleeping. We,
therefore, went up to the surface.</p>

<p>I opened the conning tower hatch and
let the fresh air rush against me. I had
a queer sensation. It seemed to me as
if we had been buried in the deep for an
eternity and had had a long, bad dream.</p>

<p>But we had no time to dream. The
storm had not calmed, but continued in
its fury, and it was not long before we
in the tower were soaking wet. However,
to our satisfaction, the water was
much warmer than in the North Sea.
We noticed that the last hours had
brought us much closer to our object.</p>

<p>It was the Gulf Stream that was
flowing by us and which, in this section,
is really warm, running between two
shores close together.</p>

<p>The night was coal black. At a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
distance astern, two light-houses flashed,
one white and the other red. It was
easy for us to know our position. No
enemy was in sight, so he must have
abandoned his search as useless. Can
any one understand with what relief we
realized this fact? Confidently we began
to look ahead to success now that,
at last, the dangers of the mine fields,
which had been greater than we had expected,
were behind us.</p>

<p>The exhausted batteries were quickly
re-charged, in order to be ready for
other emergencies, and then, with our
Diesel engines running, we went out
into the open ocean, away from the unfriendly
shores, to get some fresh air
and to rest our nerves.</p>

<p>When the day began to break, we
were twenty sea miles out and had already
re-charged the batteries with so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
much power that, if necessary, we could
proceed for several hours under water.
In the dusk of the dawn, we had a new
surprise.</p>

<p>Gr&ouml;ning, who, by chance, had looked
toward the bow where the outlines of
our boat were becoming visible, suddenly
against all rules, grabbed my arm.
With mouth open, eyes staring, and an
arm outstretched, he pointed toward the
bow.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>I ran up, bent forward, and followed
with my eyes in the direction in
which he was pointing.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; I asked him.</p>

<p>I hurried toward the bow, so as to be
able to see better. The boat&#8217;s whole
deck, from the conning tower to the
prow, looked as if it had been divided
into regular squares, between which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
dark, indistinguishable objects were
moving in snakelike lines. Near me
there was such a square. I stooped
down and picked up a steel cord about
as thick as my finger. A net, I thought,
certainly a net.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have the remnants of the net all
over us,&#8221; I shouted through the noise of
the storm to Gr&ouml;ning. &#8220;Get the nippers,
hammer, and chisel ready. As
soon as it is light enough, we must go
to work to cut it free.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the thick, dark snake&#8212;what was
that? It came up to starboard, slipped
across the deck, and disappeared to port
into the darkness. It did not take us
long to find out what kind of a snake it
was, and I comprehended everything
fully. That persistent, mysterious pursuit
by the Frenchman was at once
plain. Now I understood clearly what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
had happened on the surface after
the explosion of the mine. My heart
froze when I thought how readily the
enemy had been able to follow our
course.</p>

<p>We could easily trace the snake with
all its curves, as it became lighter, because
it was a long cork hawser, made
for the purpose of sustaining the net.
This was of light cork of about the
thickness of a forearm and was light
brown in color.</p>

<p>About two hundred meters of this
easily perceptible hawser were floating
on the water, and gave us a tail with
many curves in it. This tail, which we
had been dragging after us, gave us the
solution of the puzzling pursuit.</p>

<p>When we had torn the net, with our
engines at their highest speed, a large
piece of it to which the hawser was fastened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
had clung to our U-boat and,
after we had submerged, the hawser was
still floating on the surface and continued
to drag along behind us, still
floating when we had submerged to a
great depth. The Frenchman, who had
discovered us on account of the explosion,
had observed this, and, in spite of
all our twistings and turnings, could follow
us easily.</p>

<p>It was a master work of our able sea
crew to cut clear that heavy steel net.
The sea became still higher and washed
furiously over the deck, angered by the
resistance of our little nutshell. The
men were standing up to their stomachs
in the white, foaming waves, and had
to use all their strength to stand against
their force. Full of anxiety, I sat in the
conning tower with a life-saving buoy
ready and followed closely with worried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
eyes every move of my men during their
dangerous work.</p>

<p>All went well, and, after a half hour&#8217;s
hard work, we were rid of the troublesome
net. The nippers, hammer, and
chisel and six drenched sailors disappeared
down the conning tower. Each
of the six held in his numbed, wet fist
a rusty piece of the net as a souvenir of
the fourteenth day of April.</p>

<p>The sun arose as if nothing had happened.
From the eastern horizon it
shone over the French coast as if to
say:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am neutral! I am neutral!&#8221;</p>

<p>When it got up higher in the heavens
and sent its greeting to England, it
shivered and hid behind a thick cloud.</p>

<p>What was the matter with it? What
was it that destroyed the joy of the
greeting of the young morning? What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
was it yonder that wounded its neutral
heart?</p>

<p>A steamer approached. Thick, black
clouds of smoke poured out along her
wake and hung heavily over the sea.
She had two high, thin mastheads, two
funnels, slanting slightly toward the
stern, and a light-colored hull with a
high bridge. &#8220;A funny ship,&#8221; we decided
and submerged.</p>

<p>When we saw her clearly through the
periscope after a while, we found out
the discouraging fact that she was a
hospital ship. The snow-white color,
the wide green bands from the bow to
the stern, and the large Red Cross on
the hull and the mast tops easily identified
her as such.</p>

<p>I was just about to turn away, as an
attack upon a sacred Red Cross ship
could not be thought of, when my eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
as if by magic became glued to something
I could not make my brain believe,
something unheard of. I called
Gr&ouml;ning to the periscope, so that he
could be sure I made no mistake. No,
I was right, and, to my amazement, I
saw an insolence which was new to this
world. No wonder that the sun had hidden
its face in order not to see this
scorn and mockery of humanity. No
neutral sun could shine on anything like
that. Only the moon could stand such
lights, although they must disgust even
the moon, used to dark deeds.</p>

<p>The ship, which was safe under the
holy flag of humanity and mercy, was
loaded from bow to stern with artillery
supplies, and amongst the guns and ammunition
there was crowded an army of
soldiers and horses. Under the protection
of the colors of the flags, which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
were so atrociously misusing, they were
proceeding in the daylight on the way
to the front.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a crowd!&#8221; exclaimed Gr&ouml;ning,
and stepped back from the periscope.</p>

<p>&#8220;And such a shame that we can&#8217;t
touch it,&#8221; said I, furious, and stamped
on the iron floor so that it resounded.
&#8220;I would like to have gotten hold of it.
Such nasty people, such hypocrites!
But it can&#8217;t be helped. The boat is too
fast and too far away for us to head it
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course, we tried and went after it
at top speed for some time. But the
distance became greater instead of lessening,
and, with our batteries exhausted,
we had to abandon the chase.
Then we turned, furious and swearing,
and came to the surface again after a
little time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a very unpleasant feeling,
after a short chase, to have to lie with
exhausted batteries, and limp ahead like
a lame horse. Consequently we did not
attempt any new enterprise, but remained
on the open water for several
hours charging our storage batteries.
Just as we were about through with this
work, there came along an insolent
trawler which started to chase us. None
of us had any desire to submerge again,
because the sun was shining so beautifully,
and it became warmer with each
minute we headed south.</p>

<p>As the propeller, now free from the
nets with which we were fouled, could
give us our best speed, we immediately
began the race and hastened laughingly
and in good spirits ahead. Our boat
cut through the waves with such speed
as it showed when it first came from its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
wharf. The foam made a silver-white
mane for us. What did we care if we
got wet? We went at top speed, and,
smiling, looked at the smoking and puffing
steamer behind us.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll never catch us,&#8221; I said to
Kr&uuml;ger, who had come up to the conning
tower to ask if we were going fast
enough, or if he should try to get more
speed out of our engines. &#8220;Just keep
her turning at the same rate, Herr Engineer.
That&#8217;s sufficient. It looks now
as if we were gaining,&#8221; I told him.</p>

<p>Our pursuer seemed to realize he
could not overtake us and tried to anger
us in other ways. Suddenly a gun
flashed and a cloud of brown smoke
surrounded the small steamer for a second.
Shortly after that a small shell
splashed into the water about a thousand
meters from us and a water spout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
not higher than a small tree arose from
the sea.</p>

<p>We laughed aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a rotten marksman! He wants
to irritate us with a shotgun. That&#8217;s
ridiculous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s an insolence without an
equal,&#8221; argued Lieutenant Petersen angrily,
who felt that he had been insulted
in his capacity of the artillery officer
aboard. &#8220;We should not submit to
this outrage. May I answer him, Herr
Captain?&#8221; he asked me with eyes flashing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you may try as far as I am
concerned, Petersen, but only three
shots. You can&#8217;t hit him at this distance,
anyway, and our shells are valuable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grinning with joy, Petersen hurried
to the guns, leveled, aimed and fired,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
himself, while the water washed around
him up to his waist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too short to the right!&#8221; I shouted
to him, after I observed the high
water spout through my double marine
glasses.</p>

<p>The next shot fell close to the
steamer. It became too hot for our pursuer.
He turned quickly and went back
in the same direction from which he had
come. But the hunting fever had gotten
into our blood. We also turned
and pursued the fleeing pursuer. Show
us what you can do now, engines!</p>

<p>Shot after shot flashed, roaring from
our cannon. The distance was almost
too great for our range. We had to set
the gun at the highest possible angle in
order to have any chance of hitting him.
The first shots all fell short, or to the
side, but at the eighth we made a hit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
A roaring hurrah greeted the dark-brown
explosion which marked the arrival
of the shell on the trawler.</p>

<p>In vain, the trawler sent one shot
after another at us. They never came
near us. On our side, however, one hit
followed another, and we could see that
the hostile ship was listing heavily to
port, and we hoped to be able to give
him his death blow, when the outlines
of three of his colleagues were sighted
behind and to the right and left of him,
approaching at great speed. Our only
chance was to turn again in order to
avoid being surrounded, since too many
dogs can kill the hare.</p>

<p>Early in the evening we submerged
to keep ourselves at a safe depth. We
were very tired, because we had had
thirty-eight hours of work and realized,
now that all the excitement was over,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
how the nerves began to relax. To begin
with, the nerve strain showed itself
by the fact we could hardly go to sleep,
tired as we were. And when we did
doze off at last, we had many disturbing
dreams. I, myself, lay awake for
hours and heard through the open doors,
in the deadly quiet of the U-boat, how
the men tossed about in their bunks
during their sleep, talking and muttering.
It was as if we were in a parrot&#8217;s
cage instead of a submarine. Also
I lived over again during the night most
of the events of the past hours. The
only difference was, peculiarly enough,
that I was never the fish, but always
the fisherman above the surface who
constantly tried to catch my own U-boat
with a destroyer.</p>

<p>When I woke I could hardly untangle
the real situation, because I saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the French Captain-Lieutenant&#8217;s black-bearded
face before me, when, with
great joy in his small dark eyes, he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Diable, il faut attraper la canaille!&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE BRITISH BULL-DOG</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the morning a clear, blue sky and
a calm sea greeted us. The wind
had abated during the night and had
changed so that it came from the direction
of land, and, therefore, could not
disturb the sea to any great extent. In
the best of spirits, well satisfied and refreshed
by our breakfast, we were sitting
on the conning tower, and enjoying
the mild air of spring and puffing
one cigarette after another. During the
night we had reached the position where,
for the present, we intended to make our
attacks on the merchant transportation
which was very flourishing in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
region. We crossed the steamship lanes
in all directions with guns loaded and
with a sharp lookout so as not to lose
any opportunity to damage the enemy&#8217;s
commerce.</p>

<p>Shortly before dinner the first merchant
ship arose on the south horizon.
It was a sailer, a large, full-rigged
schooner, which, hard by the wind,
headed towards the French coast. With
majestic calm, lightly leaning to the
wind, the splendid ship approached.
The snow-white sails glittered in the
sun in the far distance. The light, slender
hull plowed sharply through the
sea.</p>

<p>With a delighted &#8220;Hello,&#8221; we hurled
ourselves on our prey. Above our heads
fluttered pennants and signal-flags
which signified:</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the ship immediately!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Sharply and distinctly in the bright
sun the command traveled from our
boat to the large, heavily-loaded ship,
and the colors of the German flag-of-war,
which floated from the mast
behind the tower, left no doubt
of the grim sincerity of the command.</p>

<p>Did they not have a signal-book over
there, or did they not want to understand
us? Ah! A flag went up on the
main-mast. The wind unfolded it and,
proudly and distinctly, France&#8217;s tricolor
could be seen. The flag stopped
at half-mast&#8212;a distress-signal! The
flag on half-mast was the pursued sailer&#8217;s
call for help. They understood our
command and were now looking for assistance
before obeying us. Wait, my
little friend, we&#8217;ll soon get that out of
you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hoist the signals: &#8216;Stop immediately
or I&#8217;ll shoot!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The signal flew up. Now, look here,
Frenchy, this is no joke; soon the little,
gray animal, which is circling
around you, will bite.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will give, them three minutes to
consider the matter, then we&#8217;ll shoot
down the masts,&#8221; I said to Lieutenant
Petersen, who was standing by the guns,
and, in his excitement, was stepping
from one foot to another.</p>

<p>With watch in hand, I counted three
full minutes. The sailer did not take
any notice of us, just as if our existence
had nothing to do with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such impudence,&#8221; I murmured, as
I put down my watch. Soon thereafter
resounded through the entire boat:</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rrrrrms!&#8221; the guns thundered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a deafening roar, and the shell whistled
through the schooner&#8217;s high rigging, in
which it tore a large hole, struck the
mainyard of the forward mast, exploded,
and snapped off the heavy
mast, so that, with its sails, it fell
like a broken wing on the deck of the
ship.</p>

<p>The results were immediately apparent.
The red and white pennant, which
in the international language means: &#8220;I
understand!&#8221; flew to the masthead. The
sailors, who had gathered in groups,
looked at us in alarm. They were scattered
by the commands of the captain
and hurried in all directions to their
posts. Giving orders in the singing accents
of the French language, the sails
were soon lowered and the ship slowed
up. The boats were swung out and
made ready, and men, with life-saving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
buoys, were running all over in great
excitement.</p>

<p>We closed in on the ship to windward,
and I called to the captain to
make haste&#8212;that I would give him just
ten minutes more to get away before
torpedoing his ship.</p>

<p>In the bow compartment, where the
torpedo tubes are built into the U-boat
and the torpedoes themselves are stored,
there was feverish activity from the minute
we saw the hostile ship and the
alarm was sounded. It is cramped in
the forward part of a U-boat, very
cramped, and it is necessary to have a
special crew of very skilled men to be
able to accomplish their purpose in this
network of tubes, valves, and pumps.
The officers&#8217; mess, which is just back
of the torpedo compartment, is quite
roomy and comfortable. It was now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
changed in a moment to an uninhabitable
place. Ready hands pulled down
the oil-stained curtains in front of the
bunks and folded up the narrow table
and the four chairs without backs.
These were all placed in a corner hurriedly,
and the luxuries were all gone,
making room to handle the torpedoes.</p>

<p>Schweckerle, in command of the torpedo
tubes, was like a father in the way
he watched over his torpedoes. He loved
them as if they were children and continually
oiled and greased them and examined
them carefully. They said of
him that he mourned when he had to
separate himself from one of them.
And I, myself, saw that when a torpedo,
for some reason or other slightly
turned, did not strike its target, he went
around broken-hearted for many days
and could not eat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>This faithful fellow was now busily
occupied taking care of his children and
had selected &#8220;Flink&#8221; and &#8220;Reissteufel&#8221;
(these were his names for the two torpedoes
now ready for the tubes) when
the command was given:</p>

<p>&#8220;First torpedo tube ready!&#8221;</p>

<p>This meant &#8220;Reissteufel&#8221; was to
go.</p>

<p>Schweckerle was in his element and,
when he gave his commands, the sailors
ran as if the devil was at their heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;You here! You there! You take
that! You take the other! Forward!
Hurry! Take hold! Get the oil can!
That&#8217;s good! That&#8217;s enough! Now
put it in&#8212;push it forward! Now hold
back! Slowly&#8212;slowly&#8212;stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>One last word of encouragement to
the torpedo disappearing into the tube!
At last the parting glance, and Schweckerle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
slammed the tube shut, and &#8220;Reissteufel&#8221;
was ready to go on his way.</p>

<p>At once this was reported to me in
the conning tower, but only a few of
the allotted ten minutes had passed and
we had plenty of time. We took a
closer look at the sailing ship before
we sent her to the bottom for good.
She was a large modern ship, constructed
entirely of steel, and had the
latest equipment over all, even in the
rigging. She could carry a cargo of
from three to four thousand tons and,
without doubt, had come from a long
distance, because sailing ships of this
size do not travel along the coast. What
kind of a cargo did she carry?</p>

<p>The French crew stepped into her
boats and left their ship. The last boat
was capsized, when it was launched, and
all in it fell into the sea. Another one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of the boats came quickly to the rescue
and picked up the swimming and struggling
sailors. When all had been saved,
I turned our prow toward the sailing
ship, which was now lying absolutely
still, and fired our first torpedo.</p>

<p>Poor Schweckerle! There it goes,
but it heads straight, Schweckerle, true
as an arrow. Bravo, Schweckerle! The
French in the lifeboats, who had approached
us where they believed themselves
safest, yelled in terror when the
detonation followed and the water spout
was thrown high above the mastheads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Notre
pauvre vaisseau!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor devils,&#8221; I thought. &#8220;I understand
how you feel over your beautiful,
fine ship, but why didn&#8217;t you stay at
home? Why do you go to sea when
you know what threatens? Why do you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
or your governments force us to destroy
your ships wherever we can find them?
Do you think we are going to wait until
our own women and children starve and
let you keep your bread baskets full before
we defend ourselves? You have
started it. You are responsible for the
consequences. If you would discontinue
your inhuman way of carrying on the
war, then we would let your sailing
ships and steamers pass unmolested,
when they do not carry contraband.
You have wanted war to the knife.
Good, we have accepted your challenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailing ship sank rapidly by the
stern, turning over on her side until
the yard arms touched the water and
the red bottom could be seen. And, at
last, when the pressure burst the forward
cargo hatch, there was a shower of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
corn, and the proud ship, with a dying
gurgle, disappeared into the deep.</p>

<p>The captain came aboard us. He
never lost for a minute his personality
as a polite Frenchman with elegant
manners. He swung himself into the
conning tower, smiled with the pleasantry
of a boulevardier, and, with a gracious
bow, handed his ship&#8217;s papers to
&#8220;mon capitaine.&#8221; In the most polite
and courteous German, I offered him
a cigarette, for which he thanked me
with a smile, as if we had been the best
of friends for years. We questioned
him. From where was he coming and
where bound? He answered frankly
and showed us without requesting it
what a valuable catch we had made. It
impressed him greatly how we were
traveling about in our little shell, and
there was no doubt he had an inclination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
to go along with us on our sea-robbing
voyage, if he could have done it.</p>

<p>When I asked him why he had not
obeyed our signals to stop, he acted as
innocent as a new-born baby, and assured
us that he never saw our signals.
Indeed, he went so far as to say he had
not even observed our U-boat until we
fired our gun. When I pointed out to
him that he had hoisted the signal of
distress long before that and that this
made his story hardly believable, he
dropped the subject with great skill and
gave the conversation a new turn. It
was impossible to catch this smooth
Frenchman, and when I had him cornered
so that another man would not
have known what to say, he slipped
through the conversation like an eel with
his great politeness.</p>

<p>I was struck with surprise to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
his men so well dressed, washed, and
shaved. I, a &#8220;barbarian,&#8221; did not want
to be behind the Frenchman in point of
manners, so I complimented him on his
crew&#8217;s splendid appearance. Then he
began to lament.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor boys,&#8221; he complained.
&#8220;They have not looked so well throughout
our voyage, but only to-day they
have been scrubbing themselves, because
they hoped to be able to get ashore to-night.
See this, mon capitaine,&#8221; he continued
and opened his log&#8212;&#8220;on January
23rd we cleared from Saigon and
have sailed nearly around the world,
and now, only a few hours before reaching
our port, we are met with such a
disaster. What a tragedy! What a
tragedy!&#8221;</p>

<p>I consoled him the best I could and
promised to assist them so that they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
could land at the same time they had
hoped. Then I, as he was about to
leave the U-boat, offered him another
cigarette, shook his hand amicably, and
sent him off the ship.</p>

<p>We had agreed that I would tow his
boats toward the coast until some new
spoils hove into sight. Then they would
have to do the best they could for themselves.</p>

<p>Soon after two o&#8217;clock, this occurred
when the mastheads with the tips of
white sails arose over the horizon.</p>

<p>We cast off from the boats, wished
the Frenchman a safe journey, and
turned toward our new prey, while
Schweckerle made &#8220;Flink&#8221; ready.</p>

<p>As we came nearer, we discovered
something that made us jump. We had
been certain that the ship which was approaching
was a large three-master,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
rigged somewhat like the one that we
had just sunk, but what now astonished
us and aroused our suspicion was that
we distinctly saw, at times, dark clouds
of smoke that seemed to be closely associated
with the sailing ship which
floated between and behind her sails.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything that you cannot explain
is always suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>In accordance with this well tested
rule for U-boats, we cautiously kept off
a little, so as to let the mysterious ship
pass us at some distance. We had heard
too much of U-boat sinking to rush at
anything blindly. What would happen
if, behind the mask of the big sailing
ship, a ready and fast torpedo boat
was sneaking which, quick as lightning,
would swoop down on us? First we
must find out with what we had to deal.</p>

<p>We could soon make out what it was.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
At a distance of about two hundred
meters in front of the sailer, there was a
strong tug pulling the full-rigged ship
with a thick hawser, so that it could
make better time. There was nothing
suspicious in this in these parts of the
sea. It often happened that sailing
ships were towed in over the final fifty
miles of their voyage to reach port before
evening, and thus gain an entire
day. The large tugboats went far out
to sea and tendered their high-priced
services.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; we thought, &#8220;there is no danger
here! But on the contrary, it looks
like a grand chance to sink a ship, and,
at the same time, send its crew ashore
safely&#8221;&#8212;the thought we always had in
mind when it did not interfere with our
duty.</p>

<p>I rubbed my hands in satisfaction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
We would give the crew of the sailing
ship a chance to get aboard the tugboat
and so send them home. Maybe they
might also meet the shipwrecked crew
of the French sailing ship and take them
aboard.</p>

<p>At top speed we headed for the tugboat.
First we circled round our prey
to be sure that we would not be surprised
by a masked gun and especially
examined the tugboat, because he traveled
back and forth daily through the
danger zone, and would be more apt to
be armed than would the sailing ship
coming from a long voyage.</p>

<p>There was nothing suspicious to be
seen&#8212;therefore we advanced. We approached
the stern of the tugboat,
slowed down, and, within calling distance,
kept pace with him. Gr&ouml;ning,
Petersen, Lohmann, and a sailor were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
with me in the conning tower. The tugboat
flew the British flag. I shouted
with the full power of my lungs:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take aboard the crew! Take aboard
the crew!&#8221;</p>

<p>I waved with my left hand toward
the sailing ship, in order to make my
meaning clear. The commander of the
&#8220;little bulldog,&#8221; as Petersen called the
tugboat, took his short clay pipe out of
his mouth, spat far out from the bridge
where he was standing in a careless attitude,
but otherwise took no notice of
us except that he may have thrown a
shrewd, cunning glance our way. I
thought he was hard of hearing and
drew a little closer and yelled again:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the crew off!&#8221;</p>

<p>The wind had increased during the
last few hours and the sea began to run
higher and was washing over our deck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
It was impossible for us to use our guns&#8212;the
crew would have been swept away
without any chance of being saved&#8212;and
we were, for that reason, unable to
emphasize our commands in a desirable
manner, but we knew what to do when
the commander on the &#8220;bulldog&#8221; did not
display any inclination to comply with
our ten-times repeated order. I had a
revolver handed to me from below and
let a bullet whistle close to the head of
the stubborn rascal. The Englishman
seemed to understand this language better.
He abandoned his careless slouch,
blew the tug&#8217;s siren, and yelled loud,
sharp commands to the crew. Then he
turned for the first time towards me, put
his hand to his cap with a short salute,
and next lifted his right hand vertically
in the air, which, according to the international
language of sailors, meant:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I understand and will obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>The crew on the &#8220;bulldog,&#8221; which in
reality bore the name <i>Ormea</i>, had, however,
cast off the hawser and were now
standing idly all around the deck with
their hands in their pockets and looked
at us curiously. The captain went to
the engine telegraph and signaled
&#8220;Half speed ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha,&#8221; we thought, &#8220;now he&#8217;ll turn
and lay himself alongside the sailing
ship.&#8221;</p>

<p>What happened next took only a
minute.</p>

<p>When the <i>Ormea</i> had gathered speed,
it certainly turned&#8212;but not to port,
which would have been the nearest way,
but towards us. At the same time the
skipper signaled to his engine room:</p>

<p>&#8220;Full speed ahead!&#8221;</p>

<p>The sturdily built, speedy tug rushed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
at us, pushing aside the waves with her
prow.</p>

<p>We had, of course, been keenly observing
every move made on the tugboat,
but suspected nothing until that
moment when he headed straight for us.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man is crazy!&#8221; I yelled. &#8220;He
intends to ram us. Full speed with both
engines. Hard a-starboard!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it looked as if we had grasped the
situation too late. The tug had gotten
a start on us in speed and came at us,
smoking copiously, like a mad bulldog.
The distance between us, which to begin
with had been two hundred meters,
decreased with great rapidity. Now the
prow was hardly fifty meters from us.
Our hair stood on end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring up pistols and guns,&#8221; I called
down.</p>

<p>These weapons, which were hanging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
always loaded, were quickly handed up
to us, and we opened a quick fire on our
onrushing enemy. Already I saw the
captain&#8217;s sly, water-blue eyes scornfully
glittering and read the spiteful joy in
his grinning face. He had good reason
to feel happy. He would reach us,
he must reach us, because he had greater
speed than we had, and his position was
more advantageous. Nearer and nearer
came the moment when would stick his
blunt, steel prow into our side, and the
nearer he approached, the harder our
hearts beat.</p>

<p>Twenty meters&#8212;fifteen meters! Was
there no escape&#8212;no hope of rescue?</p>

<p>Yes! Gr&ouml;ning, the calm and thoughtful
Gr&ouml;ning, became our savior. He
was on one knee by me on the conning
tower platform and sent one shot after
another at the oncoming target. Suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
he caught the idea which saved
us.</p>

<p>&#8220;The helmsman!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;All
men aim at the helmsman!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the pilot house with glass windows,
stood the mate of the <i>Ormea</i> by his
wheel with a sinister grin searching for
the point where the blow would be most
deadly. We saw him distinctly as he
stood there.</p>

<p>Action followed immediately on
Gr&ouml;ning&#8217;s saving thought. We stopped
the wild shooting against the dangerous
prow, and all of us aimed at the
helmsman and fired. Hardly had the
first volley been discharged when we
heard a shriek, and the Englishman
threw his arms high and fell forward
over his wheel. As he fell, he gripped
the spoke of the wheel and spun it
around. This saved us from our greatest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
danger. The prow which was to
have crushed us was only about three
meters distant when the tug was thrown
hard aport, so that it hit only the air.</p>

<p>To show how close the tug was to us,
as it swung, its stern struck our diving
tank and left a scar as a remembrance.
As the beast of prey after missing does
not attempt another leap, so the tugboat
put on full speed in an effort to
escape. The whistling of our bullets
and the loss of his mate had apparently
made a coward out of a little tugboat
captain, but we gave him credit for having
been resourceful, after we had recovered
from the excitement of the moment
and recalled all the circumstances.</p>

<p>I quietly pressed Gr&ouml;ning&#8217;s hand and
smilingly touched the spot on his breast,
there just below his brave, fearless
heart, a spot which, in accordance with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the command of his Majesty, the
Kaiser, should be reserved for the reward
due such a hero. To-day that
place is decorated with the black, silver
framed Iron Cross.</p>

<h3>HOMEWARD BOUND!</h3>


<p class="newchapter"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hy</span> should I continue relating
events which were coupled with
less danger and were less remarkable
than those we had already experienced
and which I have already carefully described?
The climax of the journey was
reached at the encounter with the
<i>Ormea</i>, and, after the climax is reached,
one should be brief. For those interested,
I can assure them that we did not
let the schooner escape which had tried
to save herself by flight, but hurried
quickly after her, and, as soon as the
crew had disembarked, torpedoed her.
However, we regretted that the captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of the tug that tried to ram us escaped
through her superior speed.</p>

<p>We were fortunate enough to make
another catch on this same day, just as
darkness was setting in, a steamer
loaded with meat, inward bound from
Sydney. We continued for several days
through this fruitful field of operation
in every direction and had both good
and bad luck. Schweckerle had to bite
into a bitter apple several times, as one
after another of his children faithlessly
abandoned him. But he had the joy of
knowing that none of them went contrary
to his good bringing-up and the
care it had received.</p>

<p>Many successes we put down in our
log and sometimes exciting episodes and
narrow escapes, when our enemy&#8217;s destroyers
and patrol ships came across
our path of daily toil, so that we should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
not be too presumptuous and careless.</p>

<p>Then at last came the day when we
decided to start our homeward journey.
The torpedoes and shells were exhausted.
Of oil, fresh water, and provisions
we had such a scanty supply
left that it was necessary for us to return.
It was impossible to tell what
kind of weather we would have on our
return trip, and, if it did not storm,
there might be strong head winds to
hold us back.</p>

<p>I decided to take a new route for our
journey home. The Witch-Kettle with
its horrors was still fresh in our minds
and we preferred to take a roundabout
way, rather than to run risks which
could be easily avoided after a successfully
completed task. In this period of
thirteen days our nerves had been affected
and there was little power of resistance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
left in them. It would not be
advisable to put them to another severe
test.</p>

<p>So it came to pass on the fifteenth day
after the start of the voyage, that a
great storm hit us and for several days
kept us hard at work. We found ourselves
far up in the North Atlantic
where the warm spring for a long time
still wears its winter&#8217;s furs, and the sun
never rises high. The icy, north wind,
which blows three-quarters of the year,
would in any event devour all his
warmth.</p>

<p>Repentantly, we had again picked up
our thick camel&#8217;s wool garments which
we had laid off in the southern waters.
The further we went north, the heavier
the clothes that we donned.</p>

<p>In addition to the cold there came a
storm, the like of which I had never seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
during my entire service on the sea, and
to describing which I will devote a few
lines, because a storm on a U-boat is
altogether different from a storm at sea
in any other vessel.</p>

<p>The barometer had been uncertain for
two days. Its hasty rising and falling
in accordance with the changes of the
atmosphere made us suspect we would
soon get rough weather. It was the
night between April twenty-fourth and
twenty-fifth. We traveled submerged
to a considerable depth, and I was lying
in my bunk asleep, partly undressed.
At about two o&#8217;clock I was awakened
and received the report:</p>

<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Petersen asks that the
Captain-Lieutenant kindly come to the
&#8216;Centrale,&#8217; as it is impossible for him
to steer the boat any longer alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>I threw on my jacket and hurried for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
the stern. On my way, on account of
the heavy rolling of the boat, I realized
what was the trouble. There must be
a terrific storm above accompanied by a
sea which only the Atlantic could stir
up.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Petersen confirmed my
opinion of the conditions which had developed
during the night and added that
he had never had so much trouble with
the diving rudder before in his life. This
meant a great deal, for Petersen was
with me when our U-boat had been
equipped for service for the first time,
and had already gone through all kinds
of weather. In spite of all the watchfulness
that he and the well-trained
crew used, the diving rudder&#8217;s pressure
was not powerful enough to resist the
enormous strength of the waves. The
boat was tossed up and down as if she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
had no rudder whatever. Only after we
had submerged twice as deep as we
had been were we able to steady the
boat to any degree. We could still feel
the force of the sea and knew the storm
must be terrific.</p>

<p>When, at daybreak, we arose to the
surface there was no chance to open the
hatches. The opal green mountains of
waves came rolling and foaming at us.
They smothered the boat with the great
masses of water, washed completely
over the deck and even up over the
tower. If any one had dared to open
the hatch and go out on the conning
tower, he would certainly have been lost.
I was standing at the periscope and
observed the wrath of the elements. It
seemed as if we were in a land of mountains
which the U-boat had to climb,
only to be suddenly hurled down again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
I could see only so far as the next
ridge, which always seemed to be even
higher than the last, and if there had
been any chance of seeing more, it
would have been impossible in the flying
foam and spray. The rain whipped
the water violently and darkened the
sky so that it was like dusk. The boat
worked itself laboriously through the
heavy sea. The joints cracked and
trembled when the boat slid down from
the peak of a wave to be buried in the
deep trough.</p>

<p>We had to cling to some oil-soaked
object in order not to be tossed about.
Through the strain put on the body by
the terrible rolling of the boat, by the
damp, vaporous air, and by lack of sleep
and food, we finally became exhausted,
but at this time we had no desire to eat.
The storm continued for three days and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
nights without abating. Then the sky
cleared, the wind dropped, and the sea
became calmer. At noon of the third
day the sun broke through the clouds
for the first time. Shortly before this,
we had dared open the conning tower
hatch and greeted the rays of the sun,
although we had to pay for this pleasure
with a cold bath.</p>

<p>We had been drifting about for three
days without knowing our location. No
wonder we greeted our guide with great
joy, and quickly produced the sextant
to find out where we were. Our calculations
showed that, during the entire
time, we had been circling around
in one spot and had not gotten one mile
nearer our port. But what did that matter?
The storm was abating, the sea
was calming down, and our splendid,
faithful boat had stood the test once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
more, and, in spite of all storms, had
survived.</p>

<p>We reached the North Sea the next
afternoon and could change our course
to the south with happy hearts. Every
meter, every mile, every hour brought
us nearer home. No one who has not,
himself, experienced this home-coming
can understand the joy that fills a
U-boat sailor&#8217;s heart when, after a successful
voyage, he sees the coast of his
fatherland; or when he turns the leaves
of his log and, astonished, reads the
scrawled lines which tell fairy tales of
the dangers and joys and asks himself:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you really gone through all
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Who can understand the joy of a
commander&#8217;s heart when, sitting by his
narrow writing table, he is carefully
working out his report to his superiors?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
&#8220;Have sunk X steamers&#8212;X sailing
ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>All around me were the happy faces
of the crew. All were satisfied, every
danger past and forgotten, thanks to
the strength of youth and their stout
hearts.</p>


<h3 style="font-weight: normal; margin-top: 2em"><i>April 30&#8212;Nine-thirty A.&nbsp;M.</i></h3>

<p>The lead was thrown. Now the water
became shallow, for we are going
into the bay&#8212;the German bay.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s twenty-four meters deep,&#8221; reported
Lohmann, who in his feverish desire
to get ashore had been up on the
conning tower since four o&#8217;clock, although
he should really have been off
watch at eight. He wanted to be the
first one to sight land, because he is
proud of his fine eyesight and was as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
happy as a child when he discovered
something before his commander did.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lead shows twenty-four!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See if it agrees with the chart,&#8221; I
called to the mate who sat in the conning
tower with the chart on his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;It agrees exactly,&#8221; the mate called
back, after he had compared the measurement
by the lead with the depth that
was marked on the chart where we estimated
we were.</p>

<p>&#8220;How far is it to land?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eight and a half miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>In five more minutes, the German
islands of the North Sea arose before
our eyes. Now we were unable to restrain
ourselves further. We tore off
our caps and waved them exultantly,
greeting our home soil with a roaring
hurrah. Our cheer penetrated into the
boat, from stern to prow, and even set<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Schweckerle&#8217;s heart on fire, where he
was sitting alone and idle amongst the
torpedo cradles.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter we glided into the
mouth of the river with the pennant
bearing our name proudly fluttering
from the masthead. This told all the
ships that met us:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here comes U-boat 202!&#8221;</p>

<p>All knew by our announcement that
we were returning from a long voyage
and we were greeted with an enthusiastic
and noisy reception. Officers and
men thronged the decks, and in our inmost
hearts we appreciated the great
cheer:</p>

<p>&#8220;Three cheers for his Majesty&#8217;s
U-202! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the proud German high seas
fleet received our little roughly-used
boat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>At three o&#8217;clock on the afternoon of
April 30 U-202 dropped her anchor in
the U-boat harbor.</p>
